Bush on Tuesday will designate nine sites in three areas of the central Pacific as marine national monuments, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday.\n\nThe new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world.\n\nThe new areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world -- 195,280 square miles -- and, coupled with a 138,000-square mile designation in Hawaii two years go, mean that Bush will have protected more of the ocean than any other president.\n\n\"The president's actions will prevent the destruction and extraction of natural resources from these beautiful and biologically diverse areas without conflicting with our military's activities and freedom of navigation, which are vital to our national security,\" Perino said. \"And the public and future generations will benefit from the science and knowledge gained from these areas.\"\n\nBush is using the 1906 Antiquities Act -- first used by President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside public lands such as the Grand Canyon as national monuments -- for the designation. Many of those lands later became national parks.\n\nBill Chandler, vice president for government affairs for the non-profit Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI), said Bush is \"to be commended\" for his action.\n\n\"From a conservation history perspective, the message here is that Teddy Roosevelt laid the groundwork for our national park system when he withdrew a lot of public lands and called them national monuments,\" said Chandler.\n\n\"We see the president laying the foundation for a system of national marine preserves and parks,\" he said. \"We had lacked such a system for a long time.\"\n\nMCBI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president will set aside on Tuesday. All but one of those eight remote areas already have Fish and Wildlife Service refuge areas at their cores.\n\n\"You have a core conservation mission already,\" Chandler said. \"This is just basically going to expand them.\"\n\nThe MCBI/EDF-identified sites are Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island.\n\nRose Atoll, part of American Samoa, is the smallest atoll in the world, but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it, and it supports 97 percent of America Samoa's seabird population. It is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species.\n\nThe Pew Environmental Fund identified the ninth site -- the waters around the northern Marianas and the deepest ocean canyon in the world, the Mariana Trench, 11,033 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest.\n\nThe new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands, where commercial fishing will be prohibited. Other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit.\n\nBush has not gotten rave reviews for his conservation efforts on land -- according to the Audubon Society, he's signed wilderness legislation covering a little more than 2 million acres, fewer than any other president except Richard Nixon. But Chandler said that Bush \"has really embraced ocean conservation as his own.\"\n\n\"Ocean protection ... is lagging 50 to 100 years behind land conservation, he said. \"This is precisely the kind of leadership that we need to get the message across that there are places in the ocean that are rich with diversity.\"\n\n\"Scientists already know this,\" he said. \"They have been calling for this for 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nThe president can cut through the bureaucracy that makes protecting resources such a lengthy process, and the Antiquities Act is a strong tool for those efforts. With the Act, the president can make a designation by executive order, essentially \"writing the prescription for conservation\" for an area, Chandler said.\n\n@highlight\n\nBush designates 9 sites in 3 areas of central Pacific as marine national monuments\n\n@highlight\n\nSites include Wake, Johnston, Palmyra, Baker, Howland, Jarvis, Marianas Islands\n\n@highlight\n\nRose Atoll, Kingman Reef also designated; New areas cover 195,280 square miles\n\n@highlight\n\nNew designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 408, "text": "280 squa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "The new areas cover how many square miles?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7099e2a67594466621748f4144681e73309b0f54.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2170, "text": "and, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island.\\n\\nRose Atoll, part"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did the sites include?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7099e2a67594466621748f4144681e73309b0f54.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2825, "text": "the"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many nautical miles will be protected?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7099e2a67594466621748f4144681e73309b0f54.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What did Bush designate?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7099e2a67594466621748f4144681e73309b0f54.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 24, "text": "George W.

He was shot three times in the head, once in the neck and once in the back, Castresana said.\n\nProminent Guatemalan brothers Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz and Jose Estuardo Valdez Paiz hired hit men at the behest of Rosenberg, who told them he was being threatened by someone, Castresana said.\n\nThe two brothers, who own a pharmaceutical company, had been cousins of Rosenberg through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination, Castresana said.\n\nRosenberg fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death, giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be.\n\n\"It was the two brothers and no one else,\" Castresana said. \"Not a politician. Not a [government] minister. Not a police chief. No one. Just these two brothers.\"\n\nAbout 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls, 9,500 documents, surveillance videotapes, and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others, Castresana said.\n\nColom had maintained since the May 10 slaying that he was innocent despite Rosenberg's explosive videotape, which was made public the day after his death.\n\nGuatemalan authorities have arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing, but the Valdez Paiz brothers remain at large.\n\nTheir lawyer, Alexis Calderon, denied last week that his clients were involved.\n\n\"This is a story being made up to implicate people who didn't have anything to do with it,\" Calderon said.\n\nHe also said that he did not know where the brothers were but that they would surrender after Tuesday's conference.\n\nCalderon did not answer calls seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nArrest warrants for the brothers were issued December 10, Castresana said, noting that the suspects were already out of the country by then.\n\nRosenberg recorded the tape blaming Colom three days before his death.\n\nHe said Colom wanted him dead because the lawyer had been blaming the president and some of his top associates for the slaying of a prominent businessman and his daughter the previous month.\n\nBusinessman Khalid Musa and his daughter, Marjorie, were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted.\n\nRosenberg was Musa's attorney.\n\nCastresana indicated Rosenberg staged his own killing to get back at Colom and high-level members of his government, whom he could not prove were responsible for the Musa killings.\n\n\"He wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder,\" said Castresana, a Spanish judge.\n\nCastresana pointed to several indicators of Rosenberg's state of mind: His mother had died; he was going through a second divorce, and his wife had taken their young children to Mexico; he was bereft at the slaying of Marjorie Musa, with whom he had a close relationship; and he felt a sense of powerlessness because he could not prosecute the people he believed were responsible for the Musa slayings.\n\nMay 10, the date of his killing, was Mother's Day.\n\nIn two April 21 e-mails, seven days after the Musa killings, Rosenberg wrote, \"I can't stop crying\" and \"I feel like I'm disintegrating,\" Castresana said.\n\nRosenberg made out his last will and testament on April 24 and started going public with his accusations against Colom regarding the Musa slayings on May 3.\n\nOn May 4, he called a meeting at his law office and said he would be leaving the firm, in which he was a partner.\n\nThe next day, Castresana said, Rosenberg asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously. Those cell phones, the lead investigator said, were crucial to cracking the case.\n\nRosenberg used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers, who gave it to the hit squad leader. Rosenberg then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone, Castresana said.\n\nCastresana detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a $40,000 check.\n\nAccording to the investigator, Rosenberg told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from Panama that should be delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers. The check had been made out by Luis Alejos, a Rosenberg friend and business associate who at the time was Guatemala's minister of communication, Castresana said. Alejos resigned from office in June, a few weeks after the slaying.\n\nAfter receiving the check, Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz destroyed it, Castresana said. The businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales ($35,900) for the assassination out of his own pocket, Castresana said.\n\nThe investigator said Rosenberg sent Alejos the money to pay for the killing.\n\nAlejos is the brother of Roberto Alejos, the president of the Guatemalan Congress, and a cousin of Gustavo Alejos, who is President Colom's private secretary.\n\nIn his videotape, Rosenberg said Gustavo Alejos would be among those responsible for the lawyer's death if it happened.\n\n\"If you are reading this message, it means that I, Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano, was murdered by the president's private secretary, Gustavo Alejos, and his associate Gregorio Valdez, with the approval of Mr. Alvaro Colom and [first lady] Sandra de Colom,\" Rosenberg said.\n\nAfter the tape surfaced, Colom went on national TV with a vehement denial that he or anyone mentioned in the video was involved.\n\nHe expressed his sense of vindication in a televised speech Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"I don't have any rancor in my heart,\" Colom said. \"Just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us.\"\n\nThe United Nations established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.\n\nThere were 6,451 slayings in Guatemala last year, of which only 230 verdicts were achieved, Castresana said. That means, he said, that more than 96 percent of the killings in 2009 were not solved.\n\n@highlight\n\nNEW: President expresses feeling of vindication at findings\n\n@highlight\n\nUnited Nations commission included 300 investigators from 11 nations\n\n@highlight\n\nLawyer left tape saying Guatemalan leader responsible if anything happened to him\n\n@highlight\n\nU.N. panel says brothers involved in arranging hit are at large", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1469, "text": "s fr"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "UN   commission included how many investigators?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 27, "text": "a videotape"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did the lawyer leave?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "what did the tape say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 6189, "text": "n't have any rancor in my"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what is president expressing?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1469, "text": "s fr"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "how many investigators?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1463, "text": "igators fr"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many investigators were there?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1492, "text": "ed"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "UN   commission is from how many nations?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 6299, "text": "\\n\\nTh"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who felt vindicated?", "id": "./cnn/stories/40237e125a636671417676ac5dec28ab697fa6fd.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b1e998cd481253945d4f174d3686ea165c8396b4.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- Hundreds of U.S. and Afghan soldiers have embarked on a major operation against militants in the eastern Afghan region of Tora Bora, near the border with Pakistan, officials have told CNN.\n\nFile photo of the remote mountain Tora Bora region on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAir and ground strikes under way in the remote mountain region are aimed at large numbers of militant fighters.\n\nThe troops are targeting \"hundreds of hardened al Qaeda and Taliban in dug-in positions,\" said officials familiar with the intelligence.\n\nThe operation started two days ago in the region, where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was once thought to be hiding.\n\nThe Bush administration has been criticized for not sending enough ground forces to Tora Bora in December 2001 to capture the militant after the invasion that toppled the Taliban.\n\n\"U.S. and Afghan forces engaged al Qaeda and other violent extremist fighters in eastern Afghanistan during a combined arms assault using precision munitions.

Under Pakistani law, police can detain someone for up to 72 hours without charging them with a crime.\n\nInvestigators have no leads in the case and are not any closer to finding out what happened to the American, whom the U.S. Embassy identified as Warren Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was abducted early Saturday when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said.\n\nWeinstein works for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, a Pakistani official said. He's is a world-renowned development expert, with 25 years of experience, according to his company's website. The site says he was heading what the company described as the \"Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness.\"\n\nAs Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast early Saturday, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain.\n\nOnce the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in while five other suspects entered the house from the back, Hussain said. The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said.

Musharraf said the 1989 \"peace dividend\" went to Europe -- East Europe.\n\nPakistan was \"left alone\" from 1989 to 2001, and during that period, the militant Taliban movement took control of Afghanistan.\n\n\"What did Pakistan get out of fighting for 10 years with you?

Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel, according to the Israeli military.\n\nMore than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many civilians, Palestinian medics said.\n\nDuring Thursday's debate, Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest, which would be impossible.\n\nHe also accused the Israeli government of \"ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians.\"\n\nBut Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a \"deeply nasty organization.\"\n\nBill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group's \"whole ethos is one of violence\" and that it had \"made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do,\" Rammell said. \"In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens.

The drug-fueled streets of the Texas-Mexico border provided his education, and he was an excellent student.\n\nDanny Santos, 21, works two part-time jobs and still doesn't make as much as he did as a drug mule.\n\nSantos says he became one of the thousands of American and Mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling.\n\n\"I didn't care. I had no conscience,\" Santos said at a boxing gym in El Paso, Texas. \"You're young, and you're naïve, and you think it's easy.\"\n\nSantos' journey into the underworld of teenage drug smuggling offers a glimpse into how drug cartels lure teenagers into doing their dirty work.\n\nUS. Customs and Border Protection officials in El Paso and San Diego report that in recent months, they've seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints.\n\nThey're often called mules. These teenagers are usually hired only to smuggle drug loads across the border. It's a short drive or walk that offers quick cash but can carry serious consequences.  Watch how teens get drugs across the border »\n\nDrug cartels \"just need someone who can legitimately cross the border,\" said Bill Molaski, the El Paso Port Director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAs an American, Santos could freely cross the El Paso-Juarez border and not raise suspicion. At age 15, Santos says, he met \"a guy\" at a party who introduced him to drug kingpins in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\n\"You start off as a driver,\" Santos said. \"People feel like they can trust you, then you move up to something bigger.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, he got a $4,000 job offer to drive his first load of marijuana across a bridge into El Paso. It was the beginning of a four-year smuggling career.\n\n\"I can't say I wasn't nervous,\" Santos said. \"You kind of project yourself into another time of happiness or joy. ... You just have to forget you have something illegal in the car.\"\n\nIn all, Santos says, he earned $50,000 making about 20 mule runs, driving right through heavily guarded border checkpoints.\n\nSantos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail. He said charges were dropped. Because he was younger than 18 when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, CNN could not confirm his story through court records.\n\nYoung smugglers don't fit a stereotype. Several sources said that both American and Mexican teens are lured into the work. Teenage boys and girls alike are involved. Many smugglers come from middle-class families.\n\n\"There's a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved,\" El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez said. His office is responsible for prosecuting juvenile smugglers.\n\nFederal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools. Depending on the size of the drug load that's being smuggled, a kid can be paid a couple hundred dollars up to $5,000.\n\nMexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in Mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits. A phone number is included in the ad.\n\nThe officials say a cartel member sets up a meeting to determine whether the kid is up to the job.\n\nBut Rodriguez offers a chilling reason why teenagers should avoid the lure of easy money.\n\n\"We had a kid here who lost a load and had some of his toes chopped off,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nSantos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago. Now he spends every day training at a boxing gym in El Paso.\n\nBoxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal.

Spokesman Raymond Kerins said that was to \"raise productivity.\"\n\nBut analysts say Pfizer is clearly trying to beef up its drug pipeline through an acquisition, adding that the company seems to have given up on its own R&D staff coming up with a blockbuster to replace Lipitor.

Such accidents have caused more than 100 deaths or injuries, mostly from scalding and burns, according to the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen.\n\nThe value of the settlement depends on how many customers respond to Sears' offer, but Public Citizen said it could end up costing the retailer more than $545 million.

William Fallon resigned in March as leader of the U.S. military's Central Command after reportedly clashing with President Bush.\n\nRetired Adm. William Fallon told CNN he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command.\n\nDuring an interview Tuesday on CNN's American Morning,\" Fallon denied a magazine article's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran.\n\nCNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.\n\nKyra Phillips: How were you informed that this was it? Who called you?\n\nFallon: The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and, I'm sure, for the president. One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command. And the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that I was disloyal to the president and that I might be trying to countermand his orders, the policies of the country. ... The fact that people might be concerned that I was not appropriately doing what I was supposed to do and following orders bothered me, and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation.  Watch Fallon break his silence »\n\nPhillips: Do you feel you were pushed out?\n\nFallon: What was important was not me. It wasn't some discussion about where I was with issues. It was the fact that we have a war in progress. We had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in Iraq and Afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what I might have said or thought or someone perceived I said. That's the motivation.\n\nPhillips: [Esquire magazine writer] Tom Barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with Iran. Is that true?\n\nFallon: I don't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran. The situation with Iran is very complex. People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we're against Iran, we want to go to war with Iran, we want to be close to them. ... The reality is in international politics that [there are] many aspects to many of these situations, and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based. At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common.\n\nPhillips: Would have you negotiated with Iran?\n\nFallon: It's not my position to negotiate with Iran. I was the military commander in the Middle East. I had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being. It's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation.\n\nPhillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, \"This is what I want to do,\" and did you stand up and say, \"No, sir. Bad move\"?\n\nFallon: It's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way. Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran. We have a lot of things going on, and there are many other ways to solve problems. I was very open and candid in my advice. I'm not shy. I will tell people, the leaders, what I think and offer my opinions on Iran and other things, and continue to do that.\n\nPhillips: Do you think that cost you your job?\n\nFallon: No, I don't believe so at all. It's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts, and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be, then we've got to make a change.\n\nPhillips: We talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president. Your critics say that Admiral Fallon is a difficult man to get along with. Are you?\n\nFallon: You probably could ask my wife about that. She would have a few things to say.\n\nI think that what's really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago, I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region. I had some experience in dealing with international problems. I certainly had a lot of combat experience, and I was brought in in an attempt to make things better. That's what I went about doing.\n\nAgain, there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so. A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items. The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home.\n\nPhillips: Hillary Clinton [and] Barack Obama talk about pulling troops out by next year. John McCain says, no, we've got to stay the course. What is the best course for Iraq right now?  Watch what the candidates say about war policy »\n\nFallon: I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there. Dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country.\n\nAgain, this situation is quite complex -- many angles. There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.\n\nThe political side of things in Iraq has got to move forward. That appears to be improving. People have to have confidence in their futures. They want to have stability. They would like to be able to raise their families in peace. They would like to have a job. They would like to look to tomorrow as better than today.\n\nIt takes more than the military, but the military is essential to provide stability and security. The idea we would walk away from Iraq strikes me as not appropriate. We all want to bring our troops home. We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended.\n\nGiven where we are today, the progress that they've made particularly in the last couple months, I think it's very, very heartening to see what's really happened here.\n\nThe right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that's appropriate to conditions on the ground.\n\n@highlight\n\nFormer Central Command chief William Fallon denies president sought third war\n\n@highlight\n\nFallon: Concern for confidence in chain of command led to resignation\n\n@highlight\n\n\"There are many other ways to solve problems\" besides war, he says\n\n@highlight\n\nFallon: Best course in Iraq is to maintain confidence in Gen.

by the world's fastest man Usain Bolt, with the Jamaican sprint star dribbling a ball to the delight of a packed Bernabeu crowd.\n\nCoach Manuel Pellegrini fielded seven new signings against a team who stunned Real 2-1 on the opening day last season to foreshadow a season of massive upheaval for the underachieving capital club.\n\nThe first goal took just 26 minutes in coming as $92 million signing Kaka fed the ball to $50 million capture Karim Benzema, whose shot rebounded off the post and fell welcomingly to Real captain Raul to score.\n\nRonaldo, who cost $130 million when he left Manchester United, then rose highest to meet a free-kick from $50 million midfielder Xavi Alonso but headed over the bar.\n\nDeportivo stunned the home crowd in the 30th minute when former Real striker Riki was allowed a free header to equalize in the type of defensive lapse that typified Madrid's performances last season.\n\nBut while Pellegrini has obvious problems to sort out at the back, where he fielded debutants Ezequiel Garay and Raul Albiol in the absence of the suspended Pepe, he has volumes of attacking resources at the other end of the pitch.\n\nHis team took the lead again in the 34th minute through Ronaldo, who coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Raul went down under goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia's challenge following a clever pass from midfielder Lassana Diarra.\n\nHowever, Real could not hold onto the lead, with veteran Juan Carlos Valeron firing a leveler from the edge of the area just 43 seconds into the second half following a cross by Andres Guardado.\n\nValeron should have made it 3-2 with an even easier chance 12 minutes later, but he sidefooted another pass from Guardado wide of the Real goal.\n\nReal continued to pile forward in numbers, peppering the Deportivo goal, but it was the unexpected figure of Diarra who netted the eventual winner in the 60th minute with a low drive from outside the box.\n\nBenzema should have doubled the lead soon after following a mistake by Aranzubia, but saw his chip over the keeper rebound off the bar.\n\nThe Frenchman made way for last season's top scorer Higuain in the 72nd minute, with the Argentine lucky to avoid being booked for a blatant dive in the penalty area.\n\nReal's rivals Barcelona start the defense of their title on Monday at home to Sporting Gijon, having already

His speech Friday was followed by an often pointed question-and-answer session.\n\n\"House Republican leaders are grateful for [Obama's] willingness to come ... and have a frank and honest conversation,\" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana. \"We welcome the dialogue with the president.\"\n\nThe president accused Republicans of frequently mischaracterizing his policy proposals, particularly in the health care debate.\n\nRepublicans, in turn, complained the White House and congressional Democrats had ignored their ideas, locked them out of the policy-making process and unfairly labeled them as obstructionists.\n\n\"Both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on Capitol Hill,\" Obama said, adding that Democrats and Republicans need to be careful in choosing their rhetoric. \"A ton of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful.\"\n\nThe president highlighted what he said was problematic GOP rhetoric on his health care proposals. Republicans, he said, had characterized the proposed program as some \"kind of Bolshevik plot.\"\n\nIn fact, he said that much of his plan was similar to what Republicans had proposed during the failed Clinton-era push to overhaul health care.\n\nBoth sides need to \"close the gap a little bit between rhetoric and reality,\" the president argued. Calling his health care plan \"some wild-eyed plot to impose big government in every aspect of our lives\" leaves little room for bipartisan negotiation, Obama said.\n\nThe president questioned how Republicans could negotiate in good faith after using such rhetoric without exposing themselves to conservative primary challengers.\n\nHouse Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he tried to be honest about differences over administration proposals.\n\n\"I truly believe a government takeover of health care ... is the essence of their bill,\" Boehner said.\n\nObama conceded there's been a failure on his part to \"try to foster better communications even if there's disagreement.\"\n\nHe has promised regular meetings with GOP leaders in the future. Boehner welcomed the gesture but said it is equally important for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Republicans a greater role in the legislative process.\n\nBipartisanship \"isn't about taking one little Republican idea and throwing it in a 2,000-page bill,\" he said after Obama argued that Democratic leaders had taken GOP proposals into account in the health care debate.\n\n\"If you're really serious about building a bipartisan product ... you need to do it from the beginning.\"\n\nRepublicans criticized the president for failing to fulfill a promise to televise all the health care negotiations on C-SPAN. Obama called the criticism \"legitimate\" but noted the overwhelming majority of committee hearings on the legislation had been conducted in front of TV cameras.\n\nAfter the bills had cleared the committees, however, it became a \"messy process,\" he conceded.\n\n\"I take responsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all taking place in one place that could be filmed,\" he said.\n\nObama and Republicans strongly criticized each other on a range of issues tied to taxes and spending.\n\nGOP leaders said Obama's $862 billion stimulus plan had been ineffective and repeatedly urged the president to consider an across-the-board tax cut.\n\nObama said it would be wrong to slash taxes for the richest Americans or the banking sector in a weak economy. He also argued that the stimulus program had saved key jobs in GOP districts across the country.\n\n\"There is not a single person in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimulus package, wouldn't be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid off, more cops laid off,\" he said.\n\n\"The component parts of the Recovery Act are consistent\" with what many Republicans say are important, he said.\n\nThe stimulus helped in terms of \"rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for families and businesses, and making sure that we were providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in.\"\n\nThe president said he agrees with the GOP emphasis on fiscal responsibility but hinted that Republicans could do more to help control spending, including curtailing legislative earmark requests for their own districts.\n\nHe also said he is willing to work with Republicans on the enactment of a line-item veto.\n\n\"There's not a president out there that wouldn't like that,\" he said.\n\nDespite their disagreements, both sides agreed the day's dialogue was a step in the right direction.\n\n\"I hope that the conversation we begin here doesn't end here, that we can continue our dialogue in the days ahead,\" Obama said.\n\nThe day \"went very well,\" Boehner replied later. \"There are issues we do agree on\" and Republicans will work to find \"common ground.\"\n\nWe should \"set aside perhaps the things that the president believes in that we philosophically don't, but if there is some common ground we ought to go ahead forward with those,\" said Rep.

They are filling sandbags as fast as they can.\"\n\nFargo city officials estimated that as many as 10,000 volunteers have come forward since Sunday to aid in a sandbagging effort that's taken over North Dakota State University's central arena, the Fargodome, and to help build levees along the now closely watched Red River. See map of affected area »\n\nThat river posed the greatest risk of about eight rivers in the state that were at flood levels, emergency officials said.\n\nThe fear is that the Red River could overtake all previous records. As of Wednesday morning, the Red River ran at about 33 feet -- 15 feet above flood stage. A record level of 41.1 feet was set in 1897.\n\nThe record level of the river set in the April 1897 flood could be surpassed Friday, Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near the city of Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday.\n\nRecent rain and blizzard conditions have swollen the rivers.\n\nGov. John Hoeven received word late Tuesday that North Dakota had received a presidential disaster declaration.\n\n\"We've had a severe winter and are experiencing significant flooding across the state, so we are grateful to receive this federal assistance as we continue the flood fight and recovery effort,\" Hoeven said. Under the declaration, the federal government will cover 75 percent of the costs.\n\n\"We're concerned about the rise of the river and how fast it's coming up, so our concern is that we're going to hit 41 feet,\" Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said Tuesday, adding that the way the levees are currently set up, they would protect against overflow only up to 38 feet.\n\nOfficials are guessing the Red River, which runs through the eastern parts of North and South Dakota, and western Minnesota, could crest in Fargo -- North Dakota's largest city, with about 99,200 residents -- anytime Friday or Saturday and that the water may linger at its crest height.\n\nThe city has canceled all trials scheduled in Fargo Municipal Court through April 2 because of the expected flooding, to allow all police officers to be available for possible emergencies, according to the city's Web site.\n\nAs of late Tuesday, Fargo residents and out-of-town volunteers had filled more than 1 million sandbags out of the needed 2 million. Mahoney said he hoped that, with the 24-hour sandbagging effort at the Fargodome, that goal will be met by Thursday. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video\n\nAnother factor threatening efforts is the possibility of freezing temperatures, because sandbags freeze together and then aren't individually stackable.\n\nDespite the stress, volunteers have been working around the clock.\n\n\"You got old people, young people -- all helping out,\" Mahoney said. \"It's heartwarming to see how many people are here.\"\n\nCNN's Robyn Sidersky contributed to this story.\n\n@highlight\n\nCity of Fargo prepares for what could be the worst flooding it's ever had\n\n@highlight\n\nUp to 10,000 volunteers have come forward since Sunday to aid in sandbagging\n\n@highlight\n\nSwollen Red River running 14 feet above flood stage Tuesday night\n\n@highlight\n\nResidents have had much less time to prepare than major 1997 flood", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1179, "text": "n at"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What river is running 14 feet above flood stage?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 696, "text": "oluntee"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many volunteers have come forward?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 696, "text": "oluntee"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many volunteers?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1279, "text": "recor"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When was there a major flood?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 649, "text": "ty off"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What city prepares for flooding?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Where is the city of Fargo?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2623, "text": "e Frida"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Wjat is the population of Fargo?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 301, "text": "d Ri"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which river was flooded?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ff68d6d33d15e36119a9fbc3d6777b76c230b75.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4c76b655f645eb856a691e48befd44277c16b4f5.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Cool suit?

She'd been bound and gagged with duct tape, raped and drowned, according to the Will County Sheriff's Office and the coroner's report.\n\nIt was June 6, 2004, the start of a horrific ordeal for the family.\n\nFox was arrested and charged with the killing, only to be exonerated by DNA evidence.\n\nMore than five years later, authorities have yet to capture Riley's killer.\n\nKathleen Zellner, Fox's attorney, said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that Riley was snatched from her home, sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned. Because her hands were bound and her mouth covered with duct tape, she was unable to swim or save herself, Zellner said.\n\nAccording to Zellner, Fox says that the night his daughter disappeared, he had gone to a street fair while the children's grandparents looked after them. On his way home, about midnight, Fox picked up his two sleepy children from their grandparents and put them to bed in the living room of the 500-square-foot cement box family home. Riley often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6-year-old brother on the chair near her while watching TV, Zellner said.\n\nFox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke, Zellner said, as was the back door. He has said he locked the front door before he'd gone to bed.\n\nThe back door's lock had been broken weeks ago; they typically propped a stack of laundry baskets against it to keep it shut. According to the family, those baskets had been removed and placed on top of the laundry machine by someone other than family members.\n\n\"From the beginning, we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night, \" Melissa Fox said. \"But it was clear that police were looking at Kevin suspiciously.\"\n\nIndeed, five months later, Will County sheriff's officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter. Zellner says the arrest came after authorities coerced a confession from him after 14 hours of relentless questioning.\n\nFox spent eight months in jail, but DNA evidence from the rape kit conducted on Riley's body finally exonerated him. There was no semen found during the autopsy, Zellner says, but saliva of an unidentified male was found on the duct tape covering Riley's mouth and elsewhere on her body.\n\nIn late 2007, the family won a $15.5 million wrongful-arrest suit against the sheriff's detectives.\n\nThe Foxes believe that the perpetrator was someone in the community who had been watching and targeting their daughter for some time.\n\n\"For weeks before her disappearance, I couldn't shake a feeling of uneasiness, strange noises at night outside our house, as if someone were lurking and watching us,\" Melissa Fox said.\n\nZellner believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a Chevrolet Cavalier parked outside the Fox home that night, before Kevin Fox and his children returned home.\n\n\"It's only been in the last few weeks that investigators have actively begun pursuing this case again,\" Zellner said, \"even though Kevin was cleared nearly four years ago.\"\n\nLast month, the FBI joined the investigation at the request of Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. FBI agents combed Riley's neighborhood and talked with neighbors and other potential witnesses.\n\n\"The FBI is bringing unprecedented resources and expertise to this investigation,\" Glasgow said in a statement. \"We cannot allow this horrific crime against an innocent child to remain unsolved.\"\n\nThe family is offering a $100,000 reward, and the FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox's death.\n\nAnyone with more information is urged to call the FBI's Chicago office at 312-421-6700.\n\n@highlight\n\nFBI joins investigation into death of 3-year-old Riley Fox, slain in 2004\n\n@highlight\n\nRiley was reported missing from home; her body was found that day\n\n@highlight\n\nAuthorities initially charged father in the killing, but DNA exonerated him\n\n@highlight\n\nAttorney for family blasts law enforcement for lack of progress on case", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1139, "text": "DNA"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What sort of evidence exonerated Riley's father?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 19, "text": "One summer night in 2004,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When was Fox slain?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1003, "text": "June 6, 2004,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When was her body found?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 45, "text": "3-year-old"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the age of Riley Fox when she died?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 56, "text": "Riley Fox"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the name of the child who was slain?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2869, "text": "coerced a confession"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the reason the family blasts law enforcement?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 753, "text": "body"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who was initially charged with her killing?", "id": "./cnn/stories/12d0816cd35e654752cf27892217ed9af425e6f5.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4e660c57fb36c03622b3ff9f9d0e78a0f7b0aea9.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut, killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders, according to American and Lebanese officials.\n\nLebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut.\n\nThe driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.\n\nBoth were Lebanese nationals, he said. An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said.\n\nLebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut's Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four.\n\nTwenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said.\n\nThe United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them,\" she added.\n\nIt was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb.\n\nA communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy.\n\nBut McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted,\" he told reporters during the State Department's daily briefing.\n\n\"We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us.\"\n\nCiting security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman.\n\nA U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night \"out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion.\"\n\nIn addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source.\n\nVideo of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage.\n\nMohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during \"a major political crisis\" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud.\n\n\"This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation,\" Chatah told CNN.\n\nTuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital.\n\nMost recently, an explosion in Beirut's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj, the head of operations for the Lebanese army, and his bodyguard on December 12.\n\nAl-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president.\n\nLebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president.\n\nThe nation has been without a president since November 23, when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term.\n\nIn February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon.

nearly six years ago. He runs an advertising agency and also writes Moscow Blog, a lifestyle blog about the city.\n\nChris Helmbrecht: \"Not many places have as much energy as Moscow.\"\n\nCNN: You've traveled around a lot -- what makes Moscow unique?\n\nChris Helmbrecht: Not many places have so much energy and so many things going on. It can be very nerve wracking and exhausting, but on the other hand it's very exciting. New York is one of those places, Tokyo too, but there are only a handful of cities in the world that have that kind of energy.\n\nCNN: You used to be a DJ -- what's your opinion of Moscow's nightlife?\n\nCH: For some people the nightlife is the best in the world, but for me it's very commercial and posh. You can sum it up in one sentence, which is a general thing about Moscow: people here live \"Sex and the City.\" They just want to go out and spend money and pretend they're rich and successful and live this dream.\n\nI recently had a conversation with the club editor of Timeout Moscow and I asked her if she thought the clubs were suffering right now with the economy. She said that in the modern \"New Russian\" culture people would rather sell their Mercedes than not go out and spend anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000 on a table in a club and admit that they're not rich anymore.\n\nMoscow is dominated by posh parties, but it's no different at a subculture place like a techno club -- you're always judged by the labels you wear, the car you drive and the music you identify yourself with.\n\nCNN: Where do you like to go in the city?\n\nCH: Novodevichy Monastery is a really beautiful old monastery. Stalin demolished a lot of churches and monasteries but this one was spared. There's a pond below it that you can walk around, and all the Russian Orthodox popes are buried in he cemetery. It's a very nice place.\n\nAnother place is would be Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills), where you can look out over Moscow. It's pretty industrial looking but it has good views. I also enjoy the center of Moscow. I like hanging out on the roof bar of a hotel, having a drink, looking out over Red Square. It makes you feel like you're away from the noise of the city.\n\nWhat makes Moscow special to you? Let us know.\n\nCNN: What do Muscovites do at the weekend?\n\nCH: It depends on the time of year, but in the summer they take every opportunity to get out of the city. Everyone has a little weekend house called a \"dacha\" and every Friday night after work people leave the city.\n\nFrom 4pm in the afternoon to 10pm at night you have long traffic jams on all the roads out of the city. People will spend three or four hours in traffic jams just to travel 60km -- and on the way back on Sunday and Monday mornings it's the same.\n\nSome \"dachas\" are really basic wooden houses and some are palaces but every family has one, or even two or three. People go out to the woods or lakes and they have barbeques, they drink and they do some gardening. They value this \"dacha\" life so much that they're willing to spend 6 hours in traffic to spend 1 ½ days in the woods.\n\nCNN: So is Moscow is deserted in the summertime?\n\nCH: Moscow is very quiet in the summertime -- it's my favorite time. You can already notice that there are less people in the clubs and less people in the streets at the weekend.\n\nTowards the end of June, Moscow is really empty. You really notice it from the middle of July until September, when it's school vacations.\n\nCNN: Has Moscow change a lot since you moved there?\n\nCH: Yes -- you can see it renewing itself. I know how it went with Berlin -- in 10 years you won't recognize Moscow anymore.\n\nStreets have changed so much in the last five years, in a good way and a bad way. A lot of cool-looking brick buildings were torn down to create business centers, but on the other hand you have great new modern buildings and hotels -- the Ritz Carlton for example. There are lots of new museums popping up, art centers, alternative art, new shops and cafes.\n\nIt's so different to when I came here five years ago and to be honest, I never would have expected it.\n\nCNN: What do you miss about Moscow when you're away?\n\nCH: I miss the excitement. There's something going on all the time. There's so much choice in terms of theater, classical ballet, the nightlife, the galleries.\n\nYou have that in Berlin but it's harder to find and not as exciting, and New York has lost a lot of its flavor, glamour and energy at the moment.\n\nCNN: If Moscow were a person, what would he or she be like?\n\nCH: An ugly princess who wears a lot of makeup and tries to be pretty! She would probably seem pretty rude, but inside she's a good person.\n\n@highlight\n\nChris Helmbrecht is a 37-year-old German who now lives in Moscow\n\n@highlight\n\nHe says Moscow's energy makes it exciting, but it can be exhausting\n\n@highlight\n\nMuscovites love to get out of the city at the weekend, says Chris\n\n@highlight\n\n\"Moscow is renewing itself.

Ever since 2009's \"Rated R,\" the relentlessly dark, blood-on-your-hands record she released after being assaulted by her then boyfriend Chris Brown, Rihanna, 23, has equated falling for someone with feeling tortured.\n\nOn last year's \"LOUD,\" she even tried to make pain seem empowering with the hard-pounding single ''S&M.'' But between ''Love the Way You Lie,'' a domestic-violence saga played out with Eminem, and ''Man Down,'' a ragga-tinged murder ballad, she just sounded like she needed a hug.\n\nSo it's a relief to find that on her blissed-out sixth album, \"Talk That Talk,\" she's stopped trying to play it so tough. ''I'll let you in on a dirty secret,'' she purrs on ''Roc Me Out,'' ''I just want to be loved.'' And apparently, love's never come so easily to RiRi, whose new song titles include ''We Found Love,'' ''We All Want Love,'' and (yes) ''Drunk on Love.'' Is she finally admitting that being young and crushed-out on someone might feel, y'know, kind of fun?\n\nAMA adult rating flat, but a hit with teens\n\nTrue, she's still got two token I-like-it-rough tracks -- ''Birthday Cake'' and ''Cockiness (Love It)'' -- but they're just filler on an album that's all about dragging you out of the bedroom and onto the dance floor. U.K. club king Calvin Harris trades Rihanna's usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on ''We Found Love,'' a song that builds and builds to a climax that's so arena-ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela.\n\nTeaming with pop vet Dr. Luke, Harris offers up more house-DJ bait with ''Where Have You Been,'' which begins with a cold-pulsing 4/4 beat before falling into a rapturous Daft Punk-style breakdown.\n\nKelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars on 'X Factor'\n\nThere's an international appeal to these songs, which were recorded in luxury suites across France, Germany, and Sweden. (For the aspirational traveler, room numbers are cited in the credits.) When Rihanna's not singing over Euro-friendly thumps, she's bouncing to a Caribbean melody, or dipping into dubstep; ''Watch n' Learn'' begins with a reggae drum fill straight out of Bob Marley's ''Buffalo Soldier.''\n\nJay-Z even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can ''fly out to Ibiza/Just to get some pizza.'' Even with all those options, RiRi's ready to settle down on album highlight ''We All Want Love,'' which begins with a Red Hot Chili Peppers-echoing guitar riff and expands into a soaring sing-along.\n\nAnd the heartfelt power ballad ''Farewell'' finds her pledging loyalty to a guy who takes almost as many business trips as she does: ''Even though it kills me that you have to go/I know I'd be sadder if you didn't hit the road,'' she wails, with just enough of a wink to make him wonder what she'll do while he's gone. Smart girl. Let him get his pizza from Ibiza, but never let him forget what he's missing back home.

The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections in August.\n\nAlmost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops, worked to clear Taliban militants from population centers in the Helmand River valley.\n\nThey have been operating in the districts of Nawa and Garmsir in central Helmand province and \"as far south as the vicinity of Khan Neshin, the capital of Rig district in the region of the Helmand River valley known as 'The Fishhook.' \"\n\nThe Marines stressed the mission \"is to provide security for population centers\" and \"connect local citizens with their legitimate government while establishing stable and secure conditions for national elections.\"\n\nHelmand's governor, Gulab Mangal, said he believes the operation will work and has assured the populace that it will provide security for them. His spokesman also confirmed that resistance had been minimal.\n\nThe Marines said about 80 percent of the American troops are in direct combat, with the rest working in support.\n\nTaliban resistance has been light and sporadic, consisting of intermittent small arms fire, the Marines said on Thursday. The troops have encountered only relatively small groups of militants.\n\n\"Indications are the militants break away shortly after they make contact,\" Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Abe Sipe said, referring to what is regarded as the Taliban's habit of running and hiding after troops confront them.\n\nA Taliban spokesman said the group's fighters had killed 33 soldiers and destroyed several vehicles. CNN could not independently verify the Taliban claims because of safety and access issues.\n\nThere has been an outcry in Afghanistan over civilian deaths in the Afghan war's crossfire, with much ire directed toward coalition air operations.\n\nBut the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan emphasized in a news release that the Marines have not \"received any confirmed reports of civilian casualties or damage to property.\" They said they have not utilized \"artillery or other indirect fire weapons, and no bombs have been dropped from aircraft.\"\n\nThe brigade operates under NATO's International Security Assistance Force.\n\nThe assault has prompted Pakistani authorities to redeploy troops along the Afghan border to stop Taliban from escaping the push in Helmand. More than 30 U.S., British and Danish troops have been killed there since January, with the latest being the Marine on Thursday and a pair of British soldiers slain in Helmand on Wednesday.\n\nThe push is the largest since the Pentagon began moving additional troops into the conflict this year, and it comes after a British-led operation launched last week in the same region, the Marines said.\n\nWhen President Obama announced his strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said American soldiers and Marines \"will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border.\"\n\nHe also said the bolstered deployment \"will also help provide security\" ahead of August presidential elections in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Obama administration has moved about 21,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the war launched after the September 11 attacks.\n\nIt is also the first big move since U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as the allied commander in Afghanistan in mid-June. In Washington, a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are \"very significant.\"\n\n\"It's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level,\" the official said. \"In fact, they often only conduct missions at the platoon level. And they're going into the most troubled area of Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe defense official said the operation is a \"tangible indication\" of the new approach that McChrystal -- a former chief of the Pentagon's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight-year war.\n\n\"They're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys; they're going in to hold the area and stay there,\" the official said. \"This approach is indicative of McChrystal's philosophy: measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed.\"\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in June, McChrystal told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the U.S.-led NATO alliance among Afghans.\n\n\"Although I expect stiff fighting ahead, the measure of success will not be enemy killed. It will be shielding the Afghan population from violence,\" he said.\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before its allies in al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. Though quickly toppled after the attacks, its leaders escaped, and the movement regrouped in the Afghan countryside and across the border in Pakistan.\n\nHelmand was once known as the breadbasket of Afghanistan, but the fertile land is now used for growing poppies. Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium, with most of that coming from the poppies in Helmand.\n\nThe drug trade is an import source of income for the Taliban and major supply routes run through the province.\n\nCNN's Atia Abawi in Afghanistan, Nic Robertson in Pakistan and Chris Lawrence and Barbara Starr at the Pentagon contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nOne Marine killed, others wounded; Taliban says 33 soldiers killed\n\n@highlight\n\n4,000 American troops, hundreds of Afghans involved in Operation Khanjar\n\n@highlight\n\nIt focuses on Helmand River valley, hotbed of Taliban violence\n\n@highlight\n\nOperation's size and scope are \"very significant,\" official says", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1970, "text": "33 soldiers"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "how many talibam died", "id": "./cnn/stories/960dd16cd295a5d015b8b056671c5dc466760a5f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 28, "text": "A Marine"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "According to the Taliban, how many soldiers where killed?", "id": "./cnn/stories/960dd16cd295a5d015b8b056671c5dc466760a5f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 337, "text": "Helmand province,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "where is the operation focused", "id": "./cnn/stories/960dd16cd295a5d015b8b056671c5dc466760a5f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 337, "text": "Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did Operation Khanjar take place?", "id": "./cnn/stories/960dd16cd295a5d015b8b056671c5dc466760a5f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 517, "text": "Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "how many troops were involved", "id": "./cnn/stories/960dd16cd295a5d015b8b056671c5dc466760a5f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 524, "text": "4,000 Marines and sailors,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many soldiers took part in the Operation Khanjar?", "id": "./cnn/stories/960dd16cd295a5d015b8b056671c5dc466760a5f.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/625376e35b8473c3d6a182e1fbe5f7d4fbadbc45.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ready for your Super Bowl party? Sure, you have drinks, hot wings, maybe even a favorite jersey. But do you have an M-16, a Kevlar helmet and body armor?\n\nPittsburgh Steelers fan Sheresa Coleman will watch the Super Bowl from the USS Mahan in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nNot everybody is watching the game from the comfort of the family den.\n\nHundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will be deployed in remote war zones, on lonely oceans and at overseas bases -- all far away from an NBC affiliate. So the military is going out of its way to make sure that many soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors can watch Super Bowl XLIII live.\n\n\"Super Bowl day has really become a holiday, military-wise, over the last couple years,\" said Petty Officer 1st Class Grant Shannon.\n\nShannon is from a town about an hour north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but is on board the USS Mahan, a destroyer deployed to stop pirates working off the coast of Somalia.\n\nWhen they finish their duties, sailors like Shannon can head to the ship's mess to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. The same is true for soldiers, Marines and airmen in combat zones.\n\n\"We can broadcast to every forward operating base in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Andreas Friedrich, the deputy director of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services, which has been sending the Super Bowl to troops overseas since the first Super Bowl, broadcasting it live since 1981.  Watch how troops will be able to watch big game »\n\nAll told, about 1 million American military personnel and civilians overseas will be able to watch the big game.\n\nSome of those watching will be benefiting from the same technology that makes Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle missions possible.\n\nA global broadcast system will beam the game to ships and submarines far out in the Pacific Ocean. GBS is how pilots in the United States can watch and fly an unmanned vehicle over a battlefield halfway around the world, and then feed what they see to the battlefield commanders on the ground below.\n\nRaytheon, the company that runs the system, will use one of its video channels to feed the game to several U.S. Navy submarines and ships in the Pacific. Tens of thousands of sailors will be able to see the game via GBS, which first broadcast a Super Bowl in 2003, according to Guy DuBois of Raytheon.\n\n\"It's a pretty amazing feeling, when you get to do that, to watch it on the ship and knowing that everybody else is back home having a good time, just like we will be,\" said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Wright, a Cardinals fan from Arizona. Wright is on board the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock that is part of the anti-piracy task force.\n\nA Steelers fan on board the USS Mahan agrees.\n\n\"It would be nice to be home and watch the game in my hometown,\" said Seaman Sheresa Coleman of Pittsburgh. \"But it's a great honor to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nOne thing Wright and the other overseas Super Bowl viewers will miss is the legendary Super Bowl commercials. Friedrich said the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services would have had to pay high fees for the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl commercials to an international audience.\n\nInstead, the multimillion-dollar ads that some people consider the best part of the game will be pre-empted in favor of Department of Defense-produced ads and public service messages.\n\nStill, even without seeing football-playing Clydesdales or movie-shilling monsters, those in uniform appreciate being part of America's unofficial midwinter holiday.\n\n\"We have lots of sailors and Marines on board who have followed the season,\" said Cmdr. Eric Cash, the commander of the USS San Antonio. \"Any time we can enjoy some traditional American sports like the Super Bowl, it's always a great time for us, a good mental break and also a good time for people to get together and socialize.\"\n\nJust like home.

Unlike Fawcett's case, it usually doesn't spread, and only about 10 to 15 percent of cases are advanced, Ocean said. Fawcett's cancer, however, is in Stage 4 and has spread to her liver.\n\nOcean said there are various causes of anal cancer.\n\n\"One of the causes is a virus called the human papilloma virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. It seems to be more common in women, in general, outside of any viral infections. Smoking is actually a risk factor,\" she said.\n\nKing asked Dr. Paul Song, a radiation oncologist, if he had seen Stage 4 cancer cured.\n\n\"Not with anal cancer. I have seen it with other GI malignancies such as rectal cancer,\" Song said. \"But anal cancer is a little bit more difficult to treat.\"\n\nDespite the bleak outlook, Song had praise for Fawcett and her documentary.\n\n\"I think one of the most powerful things that Miss Fawcett did in this documentary was give patients a sense of hope and to just show how she's handled this with such courage and dignity,\" Song said.\n\nCNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta told King that doctors have to strike a delicate balance when they are caring for patients such as Fawcett.\n\n\"You have to be absolutely honest with patients, but, you know, you don't want to strip away their hope and optimism, either.

As of earlier this year, she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse.\n\nHowever, despite her declining health and an impressive prison record, Whitehouse wrote, \"there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society.\"\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Central California Women's Facility at Chowchilla, California, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins was moved to the Chowchilla facility from the California Institution for Women at Frontera last year because of her illness.  Watch Linda Kasabian describe the murders »\n\n\"Last we heard, she is expected to attend,\" Thornton said Tuesday of Atkins. The proceeding is scheduled to be held in a hearing room, but depending on Atkins' condition, it could be held at her bedside, Thornton said. The panel is expected to render its decision following the hearing after deliberating behind closed doors, she said.\n\nAtkins -- California's longest-serving female inmate -- has been denied parole 12 times previously, Thornton said.\n\nShe was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969. She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \"Tex\" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night.\n\nTheir sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972.\n\nBy her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress, who was eight months pregnant, 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \"asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\"\n\nAfter killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage.\n\nIf the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a \"tentative suitability finding\" -- the decision is subject to a 120-day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings, Thornton said. If it still stands, the matter then goes to the governor's office. The governor's options include allowing the decision to stand, actively approving it, modifying it or reversing it, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Web site.\n\nHowever, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death. The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008. It was also opposed by Debra Tate, Sharon Tate's sister.\n\nIf parole is not granted, another hearing will be set in three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years, at the discretion of the panel, Thornton said.\n\nAtkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson.\n\nBut Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were \"so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back.\"\n\n\"The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,\" Debra Tate said. \"They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do.\"\n\nIn a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins, who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz, wrote that \"this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day.\"\n\n\"Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'\"\n\nAtkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7.\n\n@highlight\n\nSusan Atkins has admitted she stabbed pregnant actress Sharon Tate to death\n\n@highlight\n\nShe has been denied parole on 12 previous occasions\n\n@highlight\n\nAtkins has terminal brain cancer and just months to live\n\n@highlight\n\nShe was denied compassionate release in July 2008", "qas": [{"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Has she been given parole?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 178, "text": "Susan Atkins,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who has admitted stabbing actress Sharon Tate to Death.", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3481, "text": "2008."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "In which year was Susan Atkins denied compassionate release from prison.", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1544, "text": "12"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many times has Susan Atkins been denied parole.", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 45, "text": "stabbed actress"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Did susan Atkins stab Sharon Tate to death?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "13th"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many times has she previously been denied parole?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 11, "text": "former \"Manson family\" member"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who did she stab to death?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 5237, "text": "less than six months."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How long is Atkins expected to live?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7b8ef193a81719e0401da77d4681f498c6eab495.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/71016cbde14f8b9b8ab4fbce0361761acae43095.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Liverpool are waiting to learn the extent of the injury which prevented captain Steven Gerrard playing in the club's 2-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, manager Kenny Dalglish has said.\n\nEngland international Gerrard, 31, missed the match after picking up an infection in his right ankle, having only recently recovered from a groin injury which has restricted the midfielder to just four English Premier League appearances this season.\n\nDalglish also faced questions on the fitness of former England defender Jamie Carragher, who was ruled out of the match at the Hawthorns with a calf strain.\n\n\"Carragher has a calf strain.

By 2004, Siemionow was looking for the right candidate for a face transplant who wasn't doing it for vanity.\n\n\"They are not looking to go out on the street and be beautiful,\" Siemionow told CNN in a 2006 interview. \"Some of these patients, when they were interviewed just said 'I want to walk on the street and just make sure I am not sticking out.' They just want to have a normal face.\"\n\nThe doctors examined the patient's history, motivation and ability to understand the risks of the transplant. And they found Culp to be an ideal candidate.\n\nFive years after a gun blast shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip, she had a band of scar tissue extending across her face.\n\n\"The most devastating of all was the fact that society had rejected her and children were afraid of her,\" said Siemionow, who led the December 10 transplant operation.  See before and after photos of Culp »\n\nCulp, a mother of two and a grandmother, told her doctors she could understand that some adults would shun her.\n\n\"But what really bothered her the most were children -- the children that shied away from her,\" said Dr. Frank Papay, the chairman of Institute of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. \"That sense of innocence, and her not being able to see that innocence really, really affected her.\"\n\nThe shooting\n\nIn September 2004, Culp's estranged husband shot her in the face in an attempted murder-suicide outside a restaurant in Hopedale, Ohio, according to CNN affiliate WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio.\n\nCulp was 8 feet away from her husband, Thomas Culp, when he pulled the shotgun's trigger. He then turned the weapon on himself, according to local news reports. They both survived. Thomas Culp was sent to prison.\n\nDespite her wounds, she told WTOV in 2008, \"I'll always love him. He was my first love.\"\n\nAt the same time, Culp said, she felt angry. \"I wouldn't be human if I didn't. I forgive him, but I have to go on, you know?\"\n\nAfter the shooting, Culp recuperated in a hospital and in a personal care home for two years. Culp told WTOV she had vision problems and was learning Braille.\n\nHer approach to life was to \"keep motivated. Don't sleep your life away -- that could have happened. I could be depressed. I'm not.\" As she spoke, her breaths emitted a small whistle from her tracheotomy tube, which protruded from a surgical opening in her neck.\n\n\"I cannot smell. I will never be able to smell,\" she said in the interview.\n\nCulp was wrong.\n\nHow doctors transplanted a face\n\nThe doctors at the Cleveland Clinic analyzed Culp's injuries using CAT scans and developed plastic models of her skull. They practiced face transplant operation on cadavers several times.\n\nCulp met with the hospital's surgeons, ethical committee members and psychiatry and psychology specialists who determined that she was an ideal candidate for the surgery. Then, the wait for the right donor began in 2008.\n\n\"We thought we were going to wait a long time because we had to find a Caucasian female in her mid 40s to match Connie, so we expected a year before we were able to find a donor,\" said Papay, who is also head of craniofacial surgery. \"Well, three to four months later, I got a call at around midnight from Dr. Siemionow saying 'I think we have a donor.'\"\n\nThe family of a brain dead woman granted permission to use her face.\n\nHe likened the preparation for the December transplant to a rocket launch, saying, \"Everything was prepared beforehand very, very, very carefully.\"\n\nSurgeons sheared out the donor's mid-facial area including the lower eyelids, cheekbones, the nose, some of the sinus and the whole upper jaw, with the blood vessels.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the face transplant »\n\nWhen it came time to move the donor's parts to Culp, they had to see that the donor and recipient parts aligned.\n\n\"One of the ways you can tell that is how your upper teeth fit to the lower teeth,\" Papay said. \"We knew it was like a hand in a glove, exactly where we needed to be.\"\n\nThey secured the bones into Culp's face using titanium plates and screws. Then the microvascular surgeons attached the vessels. They tucked the scars around Culp's ears or underneath her eyelid, where they would not be visible.  How the doctors operated »\n\nDoctors added more skin than needed in case of tissue rejection. After monitoring Culp's progress, doctors say they will remove the excess tissue and tighten her jawline in future surgeries.\n\nContrary to science fiction and movies, the surgery did not make Culp look like the donor.\n\n\"If you just took the skin and transplanted it to the other patient, the bony structure is different,\" Papay said. \"If you took the bony structure and transplanted it on the other side, it ends up being a composite. So, it doesn't look like the donor. It doesn't look like the recipient. It ends up looking like someone new.\"\n\nRecovery\n\nAt this point, all the transplanted parts of Culp's face are functioning except for her facial nerves, which are growing about an inch a month. Doctors anticipate Culp will be able to have full facial function -- and more expression --  by this winter.\n\nIn physical therapy, she learns to train her nerves, make facial expressions, smile and purse her lips, doctors said.\n\n\"If you cry or you laugh or you smile, it's not like you think about it. You just emotionally do it. So that's a wait and see for us,\" Papay said. \"As far as the emotional one, that's really the key issue. A far as when she laughs, cries and grimaces and gets angry at you...what's her face going to look like? That's the exciting part about it.\"\n\nFive months after the first face transplant in the United States, Culp lives at home. She has checkups with the medical staff once or twice a month and will do so for the next year, her doctors said.\n\nInitially, Culp used immunosuppressants that transplanted kidney, liver or heart patients would normally take. Transplant patients must take immune-suppressing drugs throughout their lifetime to prevent tissue rejection. But she showed improvements that enabled the doctors to reduce her regimen to one medication, doctors said.\n\n\"She's taking her medications,\" Siemionow said. \"We know she is compliant. She cares about how she looks. She has her hair done in a new color...She is full of life. She does her push-ups. She's on the treadmill.

I've just got to get some help.\"\n\nBut the plane was still not at a gate, further frustrating the pilot.\n\n\"Look, you know, we can't seem to get any help from our own company,\" the pilot told the tower. \"I apologize for this, but if there is any way you can get a tug and a tow bar out here to us and get us towed somewhere to a gate or something. I don't care, take us anywhere.\"\n\nThe pilot, though frustrated, offered thanks to Bradley International officials.\n\n\"Listen, I just want to put in my two cents worth in for whatever it worth. Thank you very much,\" he said. \"It's Capt. Thompson over here on (Flight) 504 ... I think we've got more help from you guys than our own people.\"\n\nThe passengers broke into applause when the door finally opened, saying \"Let us out! Let us out!

This is the last of three exclusive reports. The first focused on the violent rules gangs live by and the second looked at  how gangsters are honored in death.\n\nForensic investigators and federal police dig bodies out of mass graves in the desert near Juarez.\n\nJUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Heat waves shimmer over the desert. A team of forensic experts clad in white overalls excavate three shallow graves.\n\nThe sand gives up nine bodies -- seven men and two women. At least one of the victims' hands were cuffed behind their back. Others had been trussed up with duct tape.\n\nThe stale stench reveals that the corpses had been dumped there several days earlier and were decomposing fast.\n\nThat grisly find in mid-March came a week after thousands more soldiers had been deployed to Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The arrival of the soldiers and more federal police agents had coincided with a short lull in the killings.\n\nSnapping photos of the scene from behind the police line was Lucio Soria, photographer for Juarez's main newspaper, El Diario de Juarez, and its sister paper, PM.\n\nPM is a perfect example of Mexico's so-called \"red press,\" newspapers that specialize in covering violence. Soria seems like a perfect ambassador.\n\n\"I've gone for a week and a half without taking pictures of dead people. I was thinking 'Hell, what am I going to do?' At this rate I'll end up taking pictures for the social pages,\" he said.\n\nSoria realizes snapping pictures of blood and gore may seem heartless. But he stays cheerful, cracking dark jokes with colleagues, all while listening to police communications on a radio scanner and searching for clues about where to find the next drug war victim.\n\n\"It might seem ugly, but that's our job,\" Soria said.\n\nHe and fellow photographers have been busy in recent months.\n\nLast year, Juarez became the poster city for Mexico's narco-violence, with more than 1,600 gang killings.  Watch musicians play \"narco-ballads\" honoring hitmen »\n\nThis year, Mayor Jose Reyes is trying to turn a page on the killings and make Juarez a showcase for solutions.\n\nMilitary and federal police convoys patrol the streets around the clock. Cops armed with AR-15 assault rifles, identities obscured by ski masks, hang off pickup trucks that speed around in twos and threes.  Watch cops round up gang suspects »\n\nSoldiers strike a warlike pose behind heavy machine guns mounted on American-made Humvees.\n\nWhether it's working depends on whom you ask and how hard you read between the lines.\n\n\"I think this is very effective because it closes transport routes for the movement of [cartel] personnel and weapons,\" said a state officer, assigned to guide us, at a federal police checkpoint.\n\nThe officer, known only by his call sign Trojan One, seemed confident.\n\nThe agent in command of the checkpoint was less convinced.\n\n\"Of course organized crime is trying to avoid us. I'm not sure what methods they use to operate. We don't know how they work,\" said the officer, identifying himself only as Aztec One.\n\nOn another day we ran into a three-truck federal police operation staking out a house in a middle-class Juarez neighborhood.  See photos of police, gang life in Mexico »\n\nThe commander said his men believed they had made what he termed a \"major\" cocaine bust. When I met him they had already been waiting almost 24 hours for a judge to issue a search warrant.\n\nWhen they gained access they discovered some 500 half-gram bags of cocaine. In Juarez those bags sell for around $8. Now do the math, 500 half-gram bags at possibly 60 percent purity means around 150 grams of pure cocaine -- hardly a major strike in the drug war.\n\nReyes' solution has been to hand the military all civilian police functions, even down to traffic control. Mexico's military has little experience in urban warfare, little experience in policing and has been unable to shake a decades-old reputation for human rights abuses.\n\nWhen I bump into Reyes at a transfer-of-command ceremony at city hall I ask him what he's doing about alleged corruption and complicity among politicians and businessmen, who permit the cartels to move their shipments and help launder the proceeds.\n\n\"My opinion in Juarez is that that kind of political corruption does not exist,\" he said adamantly.\n\nTwo weeks later, in Monterrey, I caught up with outspoken lawyer Raquenel Villanueva. She knows a thing or two about politicians colluding with Mexico's mafia.  Watch how drug lords pay tribute to a highway bandit, looking for luck »\n\nMexican media have dubbed her the \"devil's advocate\" for her role in defending a string of senior cartel figures and their hitmen. Last year, she was detained for 90 days, accused her of being a member of the Gulf Cartel. She was freed without charge.\n\nThroughout her career, she's survived four assassination attempts and taken 10 bullets, two of them in the head.\n\nHer office is crammed with religious iconography: crosses, paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe and a four-foot-high wooden statue of Saint Jude Thaddeus. Two bullets are encrusted in the effigy after the last attempt on her life in 2000.\n\n\"I know about official corruption and exactly who is doing what because my clients tell me,\" she said.\n\n\"To win the drug war you have to tell the Americans to take better care of their young people, tell them to stop being so cold and materialistic,\" Villanueva lectured. \"Then you have to end corruption and that means changing the government cabinets of half the countries in the world.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nBorder city of Juarez last year had more than 1,600 gang killings\n\n@highlight\n\nMayor turns to military to control trafficking, violence\n\n@highlight\n\nOpinions vary on whether tactics are working\n\n@highlight\n\nLawyer puts some blame on \"materialistic\" Americans", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 5377, "text": "know about official corruption and exa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is says Lawyer?", "id": "./cnn/stories/ef5729e2480d0abe3a335d04496cdc9f68963eb1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 5564, "text": "ung people,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who puts blame on materialistic Americans?", "id": "./cnn/stories/ef5729e2480d0abe3a335d04496cdc9f68963eb1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 5642, "text": "tured. \"Then you have to end corruption and that means chang"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who do lawyers blame?", "id": "./cnn/stories/ef5729e2480d0abe3a335d04496cdc9f68963eb1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2082, "text": "'s narco-violenc"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many gang killings happened last year in Juarez?", "id": "./cnn/stories/ef5729e2480d0abe3a335d04496cdc9f68963eb1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2082, "text": "'s narco-violenc"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "how many gang killings occurred last year?", "id": "./cnn/stories/ef5729e2480d0abe3a335d04496cdc9f68963eb1.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/242a79e95c93576fc1364aa7e034f4399af00feb.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- A drunk passenger tried to hijack a Turkish Airlines flight to Russia on Wednesday before he was brought under control, the head of Turkey's civil aviation authority said.\n\nThe Turkish Airlines passenger jet was en route from Turkey to Russia when the incident took place.\n\nThe plane landed safely and on time Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg.

Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.\n\nTwo immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.\n\nBoth are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.  Watch why the former detainees claim abuse »\n\nDr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered.\n\n\"I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,\" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.\n\n\"That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world.\"\n\nThe allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers.\n\n\"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,\" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.\"\n\nACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, \"It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.\"\n\nResponding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"medical escorts\" for deportation since 2003.\n\nFrom October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication \"because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,\" she said.\n\n\"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,\" Myers said.\n\nShe added no detainee should be \"involuntarily medicated without court order,\" except in emergency situations.\n\nBut both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.\n\nSoeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected\n\n\"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,\" he said through broken English.\n\nHe says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.\n\nSoeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.\n\nIn the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.\n\nICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation.\n\n\"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,\" the ICE statement said. \"Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication.\"\n\nBut, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country.

The legislation would allow a company's employees to openly sign a card demanding a union and then, if a majority sign, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate. The act would also stiffen federal laws that bar employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union.\n\nBut while the battle is just beginning on Capitol Hill, business owners like Dave Bego have been in the center of the fight for some time.\n\nBego, of Indianapolis, Indiana, is the owner of EMS, a company that provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire by one of the nation's most powerful labor organizations, the Service Employees International Union.\n\nThe 1.8 million-member SEIU argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years. But Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.  Watch how company, union are at odds »\n\nHe said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. He said his workers don't want a union, because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues.\n\n\"We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],\" Bego said. \"They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so.\"\n\nBut union workers CNN talked to said EMS employees are afraid to speak publicly because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was. She said EMS fired her after she complained about what she said were unsafe conditions.\n\n\"We're not the only ones,\" Brown said. \"There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same similarities or different similarities, but they're going through things that are not right and not safe.\" That's why she supports the Employee Free Choice Act, she said.\n\n\"When polls show that 60 percent of the workers in America want to organize, yet only 7 percent belong to unions, you know something's broken,\" one of the bill's sponsors, Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, told Wednesday's union rally in Washington.\n\nThe option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the \"card check\" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join.\n\n\"Card check is real simple,\" Bego said. \"They want to eliminate the secret ballot election. And that is kind of like saying, 'We're going to elect the president of our country by signing cards. We're going to go door to door and you're going to sign a card for who you want to be president.' \"\n\nBego said if his employees want a union, they should be able to secretly vote for one. He offered to hold union elections at his company, but only if they were monitored by the National Labor Relations Board and involved secret ballots.\n\nHe said the union did not respond, but continued the protests. He took out an ad in the Indianapolis Star, challenging SEIU to \"fish or cut bait.\"\n\nAndy Stern, president of the SEIU and a major supporter of President Barack Obama, said the legislation provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union.\n\n\"This isn't necessarily an election,\" Stern said. \"This is people wanting to start an organization.\"\n\n\"This is workers' choice,\" Stern said. \"They can have a secret ballot, or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards.\"\n\nStern would appear to have the muscle to push the legislation through Congress. The SEIU was the largest contributor to Democratic campaigns this election, pumping $85 million into campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives.\n\nThe union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for Obama's election, and Stern said politicians who made the unions promises during the campaign now need to keep them.\n\n\"We can lobby, we can petition, we can use the same things we use in the electoral process to un-elect people,\" he said.\n\nAsked if elected officials should be afraid of him, Stern replied, \"Everyone should be scared\" of not living up to promises.\n\nCNN's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nBill would let employees openly sign a card demanding a union\n\n@highlight\n\nIf a majority sign, company would have 90 days to negotiate\n\n@highlight\n\nCurrent method of deciding whether to organize -- secret ballot -- would still be option\n\n@highlight\n\nUnion workers give Congress estimated 1.5 million signatures backing bill", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 499, "text": "negotiate."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "The bill would let employees do what?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 488, "text": "90"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many days would the company have to negotiate?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3071, "text": "effectively eliminate union elections,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What would the bill do?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 47, "text": "1.5 million"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many signatures were handed in?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 47, "text": "1.5 million"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many signatures backed the bill?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 47, "text": "1.5 million"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many signatures backing the bill were give to congress?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 488, "text": "90 days"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How long would the company have to negotiate?", "id": "./cnn/stories/43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Just like any other first family in the world, North Korea's secretive Kim dynasty is often the focus of gossip and rumors, especially in neighboring South Korea.\n\nThere was a lot of speculation after a recent report that Kim Jong Il's grandson, identified as 16-year-old Kim Han-sol, was scheduled to enter an international school in Bosnia. Less than a week after the report, YouTube screen shots and pictures -- reportedly of the grandson -- have been plastered on the news in South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that it had tracked down photos of the grandson from the Bosnian school's Facebook page and published the pictures. The young man appears in photos wearing a suit and black horn-rimmed glasses posing with a woman at what appears to be a party.\n\nIn another photo, the young man sports a blonde hairdo and is wearing a black T-shirt on the streets. The news agency reported Kim's nationality on the school website was set as North Korean. The school, the United World College in Mostar, confirmed its acceptance of a 16-year-old North Korean student named Kim Han-sol through a press release but stopped short of confirming the identity of the individual.\n\n\"The entry of a student from North Korea, furthermore from a very well-known family, has understandably generated surprise and comment, some of it critical,\" it said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Han-sol is the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-nam is the family's most outspoken member and has been seen at airports and other venues outside of North Korea. He is viewed by many as the outcast of the Kim family. It is believed the oldest Kim fell out of favor when he was stopped in Japan trying to enter on a forged passport on his way to Disneyland in 2001.\n\nThe South Korean media has also focused on YouTube postings that Yonhap News Agency says feature Kim Han-sol. Yonhap released shots in which the YouTube user claims to be a North Korean studying in Macau. The person also claims to be \"related (to the Kim family).\"\n\nCNN could not independently confirm the identity of the YouTube user or the person shown in the pictures in the South Korean media. There are no known public photographs of Kim Han-sol and there's been no comment from the Kim family.\n\nThe reclusive nature of the family leaves media outlets to leap at whatever opportunity they can to gain more insight into the lives of the Kim Jong Il family. Experts have commonly used photos released by the North Korean state-run news agency to speculate on the health of Kim Jong Il, examining facial color, posture, and even the style of shoes the leader is wearing.\n\nBut the lack of access to verify most of what is circulated in the news has also led to blunders in the past. A photograph once released as an exclusive shot of one of the leader's sons later turned out to be an average South Korean man. The incident was only corrected after the man in the photo spoke out saying he was shocked to see he had turned into a Kim dynasty member overnight.\n\nAs the latest round of speculation continues, the YouTube account reportedly linked to the grandson is no longer accessible and has been closed.\n\n@highlight\n\nYonhap News Agency has published alleged photos of Kim Jong Il's grandson\n\n@highlight\n\nThe 16-year-old Kim Han-sol will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school\n\n@highlight\n\nThe reclusive North Korean first family is rarely shown in photographs", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 304, "text": "m Han-sol, wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who  will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school?", "id": "./cnn/stories/90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 375, "text": "ss than a week af"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "when The 16-year-old Kim Han-sol will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school?", "id": "./cnn/stories/90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 99, "text": "Kim"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "whose  family is rarely shown in photographs?", "id": "./cnn/stories/90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 410, "text": "uTube sc"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who  has published alleged photos of Kim Jong Il's grandson?", "id": "./cnn/stories/90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 629, "text": "ian school's Facebook page and"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did the pictures come from?", "id": "./cnn/stories/90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/528dd38be55bad5a3cca4a424fec288b720a309a.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ATLANTA, Georgia -- Going back to work after my wife had our first child was an emotional roller coaster.\n\nThe author says that being \"Mr. Mom\" is appealing, but putting the idea into practice is harder than it looks.\n\nI forced myself out of bed, shaved my beard and got dressed on the morning of my return. I performed these work week rituals while cursing the fact that I matched only one number on my last lottery ticket, so I had to show up that day.\n\nAfter being out of the office for a little more than two weeks on paternity leave, I knew the transition back to work would be tough. I coped with this fact, like any rational new parent would, by increasing the number of lottery tickets that I purchased.\n\nSaying goodbye took a while. I made several trips up and down the stairs to get one more glimpse of my daughter before succumbing to the inevitable: my commute, fighting traffic and reintegrating to cubicle culture.\n\nI arrived at the office still thinking of my family at home without me. I found myself misty-eyed at the water cooler while I waited for Outlook to load several hundred unread e-mails. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to be at home with my daughter.\n\nThe idea of being a stay-at-home dad, like Michael Keaton in \"Mr. Mom,\" always appealed to me. For the uninitiated, the 1983 comedy is about an out-of-work father faced with domestic challenges while his wife gets a job.\n\nA memorable scene has the title character, Jack Butler, trying to sound like he knows what he's talking about to his wife's new boss. He tells him that he plans to wire a new wing of his house in \"220, 221, whatever it takes.\"\n\nI identify with the latter part of his character's claim. It's not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement, but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work, I plan on doing whatever it takes.\n\nIn 2007, 37 percent of working dads admitted that they would leave their jobs if their family could afford it, according to CareerBuilder.com. The \"if\" in that statistic is a big one.\n\nUnlike the characters in \"Mr. Mom,\" my wife and I both need to work. A good sequel to this film may have explored the hijinks that ensued from an overwhelmed parent caring for a newborn while working from home.\n\nNowadays, there's support for all of the Jack Butlers out there. Web sites such as AtHomeDad.org and Rebeldad.com have established online communities dedicated to providing tips and resources for fatherhood.\n\nThese forums represent a growing fellowship where those with experience can help new dads. Personally, I haven't utilized them much yet because of that old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be a member of a club that would have a person like me as a member.\n\nAvailable resources and social acceptance for stay-at-home dads have come a long way since \"Mr. Mom's\" portrayal of them. In fact, Salary.com calculated that a stay-at-home dad was worth $125,340 a year for the dad portion of his work in 2006. This analysis took into account tasks that range from cooking and cleaning to teaching and serving as a child psychologist.\n\nSince I can't convince anyone to pay me my estimated worth as an at-home dad -- and living on one salary isn't an option for my family -- I've considered working from home a couple of hours a week when necessary.\n\nFlexible work schedules make sense because they benefit a company by allowing employees to be more productive on their terms. Nevertheless, working from home may not be for everyone.\n\nI work for a news Web site, facilitating advertisement opportunities. A lot of my job's communication occurs via e-mail, which is something I can do at home.\n\nI'd worked from home before, but not with a newborn in the house. My first test was only for a couple of hours when the baby was about 3 weeks old.\n\nMy wife had an early appointment, and I was going to watch the baby sleep, hopefully, and then go into the office after she got home. I had e-mail to check and two conference calls scheduled back-to-back during that time. I didn't expect this to be too difficult.\n\nI caught up on the e-mail much earlier than if I had gone into the office that morning. Unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals, my productivity was already soaring and I was ahead of schedule.\n\nThen disaster struck.\n\nAs I called into my first meeting, the baby started to stir, squirm and make her signature sounds (a primal series of grunts, snorts and whimpers). She was telling me that her diaper needed to be changed and that she was probably hungry, too.\n\nSo I did what any multi-tasker would do: I put the phone under my ear, stuck her bottle under the tap, muted the phone, ran up the stairs with her in a tucked football position, unmuted the phone, answered a question, muted again, changed her diaper and ran down the stairs to get the bottle.\n\nMy wife called while I was juggling the baby, diaper, bottle and meeting to let me know that she was running late. I screamed to myself, \"I need help NOW!\"\n\nAllowing the nervous breakdown to run its course, I continued to pace across my living room floor -- regretting that I hadn't chosen decaf that morning.\n\nA few minutes later, I jumped out of the first meeting to call into the second. I said, \"Hello, this is Josh, I'm here on mute, OK, thanks.\"\n\nAs I listened in on mute, I shushed my baby to calm her -- to no avail. Her cries became increasingly louder.

I told her that I didn't think it would be a good idea for me to work from home anymore.\n\nI realize that the ability to work and be a nanny simultaneously is a skill requiring practice.\n\nOne trial run as a telecommuter with a newborn has caused me to question the feasibility of being able to do it on a regular basis.\n\nPerhaps it's time for me to forget about that old Groucho Marx joke and accept some help.

Jackson, South Carolina\n\nTranscript\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nNATISHA LANCE, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A member of the military is making history. We'll explain how in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off this week. I'm Natisha Lance.\n\nFirst Up: Afghan Crashes\n\nLANCE: First up, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The countries share a border, and they also share a common problem: threats from militant groups and terrorists like the Taliban and al Qaeda. It's an issue facing both nations' governments, and one that the U.S. government is concerned about as well. That's why President Obama has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers. They're reviewing the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Samantha Hayes has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\nSAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for Americans in Afghanistan. While a NATO security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame, the loss of 14 Americans comes while President Barack Obama is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight al Qaeda. The president addressed service men and women in Jacksonville, Florida Monday, after a White House meeting with his national security team.\n\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Fourteen Americans gave their lives, and our prayers are with these service members, their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them.\n\nHAYES: The deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers, and three DEA agents were among those killed. Also among the dead, three U.S. civilians, members of the embassy community. The State Department says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission.\n\nJACOB LEW, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: Improving Afghan governance, providing security, justice, jobs and services, and giving the Afghan people a meaningful alternative, as much as possible, to the Taliban's recruiting.\n\nHAYES: Democratic Senator John Kerry, off of a recent trip to the region, addressed those efforts and the U.S. relationship with the Afghan government in a Washington speech.\n\nSEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: The fact that the Afghan government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility.\n\nHAYES: President Obama's White House meeting was the sixth in a series of high-level discussions about what to do in Afghanistan, as the administration awaits results from that country's November 7th presidential runoff. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes.\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\nI.D. Me\n\nCNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in 1939 in Searchlight, Nevada. I was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, and I'm currently the Senate Majority Leader, which means I'm the highest ranking member of the Senate's majority party. I'm Harry Reid, a Democrat who is the senior senator from Nevada.\n\nPublic Option\n\nLANCE: And in that role as majority leader, it's Sen. Reid's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire Senate. Yesterday, Sen. Reid announced that the combined bill will include a government-run health care program; what's been called the public option. During his announcement, Reid also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option. They would have until the year 2014 to make that decision.\n\nThis has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform. Critics argue that if companies use the public option, then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with. But Sen. Reid believes it's an important part of the reform.\n\nSEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system. It will protect consumers, keep insurers honest, ensure competition, and that's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted, that will be submitted to the Senate.\n\nTea Party Protests\n\nLANCE: Meanwhile, the Tea Party Express is back on the road, protesting issues like government involvement in health care. The Express, which is named for both the organization and its bus, launched a new tour Sunday in California with rallies in San Diego and Los Angeles, where some people actually showed up to protest the Tea Party protesters. The Express plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks. One of the group's main goals is the push for less government involvement, and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views.\n\nCHRIS KEAYS, TEA PARTY PROTESTER: We need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families, and the government is not a part of my daily life. I really resent the government taking up so much of my time that I'm down here having to protest right now.\n\nNew Jobs Outlook\n\nLANCE: And some potentially good news for the U.S. economy: A new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future. The report from the National Association of Business Economics says for the first time since the recession started nearly two years ago, the number of employers planning to hire workers over the next six months is higher than the number of jobs that are expected to be cut during that same time. The country's current unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. That's the highest the statistic has been in more than a quarter century.\n\nShoutout\n\nTOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What base is home to the U.S. Army's Drill Sergeant School? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Fort Bragg, B) Fort Hood, C) Fort Jackson or D) Fort Knox? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Army's Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!\n\nTop Drill Sergeant\n\nLANCE: Drill sergeants are responsible for training tens of thousands of soldiers every year. And the head of the Drill Sergeant School, its commandant, is responsible for training them. The current commandant broke new ground when she took over the position last month because she's the first she to head up the school. Jason Carroll introduces us to this trailblazing soldier.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\nJASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Historically, this is the image of the military drill sergeant: a tough guy. That was then; this is now. At 48, Command Sergeant Major Teresa King is the first woman to lead the Army's Drill Sergeant Training School.\n\nWhat are you looking for? I mean, because it all pretty much looks like everybody's exercising to me.\n\nCMD. SGT. MAJOR TERESA KING: I'm looking for attention to detail, conformance.\n\nCARROLL: Before sunrise at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, King readies her drill instructor candidates for a rigorous run.\n\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\nKING: That's too big, Top. You need to break it up.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fall out!\n\nCARROLL: She leads by example. King runs the five-mile course from the front of the pack, outperforming men half her age.\n\nSTAFF SGT. LERON DELANEY, U.S. ARMY: She's older than me, so if I fall out and she's still running, I feel bad.\n\nCARROLL: Extinguishing those who think a woman can't be commandant.\n\nSGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL CHILDS, U.S. ARMY: We've got to stay on top of our game even more than we used to with her, because she's that sharp.\n\nCARROLL: King says she wakes up some mornings still shocked she is commandant.\n\nKING: I had never considered it, although I've been in training for about seven years. But I never considered it, the Drill Sergeant School.\n\nCARROLL: King's first Army job some 30 years ago was postal clerk, but her hero, General George Patton, inspired her.\n\nKING: I saw that he had the respect of his men. And I saw he was resolute.\n\nCARROLL: King eventually rose through the ranks, excelling at training infantry men and paratroopers alike.\n\nKING: I'm doing what I've always done. It's just now, people are paying attention to it.\n\nCARROLL: And to her opinions. The military prohibits women from serving in front line combat roles. King trains men for combat and thinks it's time to train qualified women.\n\nKING: I think if they can do it, they should be allowed to do it.\n\nCARROLL: The reality: Women make up 14 percent of active soldiers in the Army. Some women question how many others will follow in King's footsteps.\n\nOPERATIONS SGT. ANGELA ANDREWS, U.S. ARMY: I wouldn't say it opens the door, but it may crack it somewhat.\n\nCARROLL: King says she will continue to lead by example.\n\nKING: I have vision. And I believe I can cause people to do some things that they thought they never could do.\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\nBefore We Go\n\nAZUZ: Before we go, some science projects can balloon out of control. Which was the whole point of this experiment in Indiana. College students filled this high altitude balloon with helium and then let it fly away. The thing actually climbed 90,000 feet before... awww. Looks like their bubble burst. Actually, they knew it would. The cameras and sensors inside the balloon gently parachuted back to the ground. So in the end, the experiment was a total success.\n\nGoodbye\n\nAZUZ: Just don't tell that to the students. We wouldn't want them to get an inflated ego. That's all the time we have for today.

His memorial will now be there.\n\nNo other details about the service, set to begin at 10 a.m. Tuesday, have been revealed.\n\nThursday, CNN learned the family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge to the contents of the trust.\n\nKatherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said.\n\nThe children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- will also share 40 percent of the estate's assets and the remaining 20 percent will benefits charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.\n\nJackson's will did not specify where he wished to be buried.\n\nMany of his fans had hoped they'd get a chance to pay last respects at Neverland Ranch, which Jackson purchased in 1987, filled with animals and amusement rides, and named after the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\nA public viewing at the ranch on Friday also had been under consideration, law enforcement sources said.\n\nGregory Son, a 31-year-old musician, was among many fans who had planned to ride to the ranch to say goodbye to Jackson.\n\n\"I think he was a modern-day prophet,\" Son said outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. \"We kind of lost our father.\"\n\nDEA joins investigation\n\nOn Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson's death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon's passing.\n\nTwo law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA probe, saying agents would look at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.\n\nNeither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter.\n\nOfficially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles, California, police department -- which would not confirm the involvement.\n\n\"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act,\" said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. \"However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson.\"\n\nSpeculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died on June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications.\n\nPolice did not say whether they found anything.\n\nMurray's lawyers issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner's tests are complete.\n\n\"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson,\" the statement said. \"We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo.\"\n\nThe comments were in reaction to a claim by a nutritionist who said Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for the powerful sedative, Propofol, despite knowing its harmful effects.\n\n\"I told him this medication is not safe,\" said Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse. \"He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.' \"\n\nWill nominates Jackson's mother as kids' guardian\n\nMeanwhile, details of Jackson's will -- written on July 7, 2002 -- showed that the singer estimated his estate to be worth at least $500 million.\n\nIn it, he nominated his mother, Katherine Jackson, as the guardian of his three children.\n\nIf his 79-year-old mother is not living, \"I nominate Diana Ross as guardian,\" Jackson stated.\n\nSinger Ross, 65, is a lifelong friend of Jackson's.\n\nThe will said Jackson \"intentionally omitted\" his former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe.\n\nIt will be up to a court to decide who gets custody of the children, ages 7, 11 and 12. Rowe has not publicly indicated whether she will challenge the Jacksons for custody.\n\nThe two men whom the will named as executors immediately filed a request to take control of the estate.\n\nOne is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death. He helped acquire Jackson's music catalog, which is worth millions.\n\nThe other is music industry executive John McClain, a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet.\n\nThe men said in their filing in Los Angeles Superior Court that control of the estate would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations.\n\nJudge Mitchell Beckloff held an emergency hearing Wednesday morning and decided there was no urgency to replace Katherine Jackson -- whom he appointed temporary administrator earlier this week.\n\nAnother hearing has been set for Monday.\n\n-- CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this

[{"context": "QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Motorcycle accidents have killed more Marines in the past 12 months than enemy fire in Iraq, a rate that's so alarming, it has prompted top brass to call a meeting to address the issue, officials say.\n\nDespite crashes, Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker rides a sport motorcycle. \"I enjoy it. ... It relaxes me,\" he says.\n\nTwenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. In that same period, 20 Marines have been killed in action in Iraq.\n\nThe 25 deaths are the highest motorcycle death toll ever for the Marine Corps.\n\nGen. James Amos, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told CNN that commanders are trying to drill down on what \"we need to do to help our Marines survive on these sport bikes.\"\n\n\"The Marines are very serious about it,\" he said.  Watch these aren't your father's Harleys »\n\nMarine Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker knows all too well about the dangers of sport bikes. An owner of a Kawasaki Ninja, Tucker has had two crashes, and the second one nearly killed him.\n\n\"I sustained a broken collar bone; I tore the shoulder out of the socket; I tore three ligaments in the shoulder, the rotator cuff; I broke three vertebrae,\" said Tucker, a drill instructor for new officers.\n\n\"The worst was a head injury I received: a bruised brain. And it caused hemorrhaging, and from that I had partial paralysis of the left leg, full paralysis of the left foot and toes, and that was for approximately six months.\"\n\nAmos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday \"focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues.\" The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, and other senior leadership will attend the meeting at the Quantico, Virginia, Marine base, he said.\n\nAbout 18,000 of the nearly 200,000 Marines are believed to own motorcycles, Amos said.\n\nThe Marines have taken some measures. The Marine Corps has had a long-standing policy for all Marines who ride motorcycles to take a mandatory basic riding course. More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes.\n\nAny Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say.\n\nOn a recent day at the Quantico training track, Marines whizzed by on their bikes.\n\n\"I think the basic rider course has been great,\" said Cpl. Austin Oakley. \"Here, they put you in situations you want to be wary of out in that open road.\"\n\nOakley said he recently returned to the United States from Japan, and he immediately jumped at the chance to buy a sport bike. He said it's not uncommon for Marines to have motorcycle clubs within their units.\n\n\"We'll go out on rides together. Fridays for lunchtime, we'll all meet up and go to lunch,\" Oakley said. \"When I get on my motorcycle, it's me and the motorcycle. I don't need to go fast. I don't need to do anything like that. It's just being free.\"\n\nThe rise in motorcycle deaths isn't confined to Marines. The Navy says it's had 33 deaths on motorcycles over the past 12 months, a 65 percent jump from the previous time period. And authorities say motorcycle deaths have been a problem in the civilian world, too.\n\nMilitary officials say they're not sure why the deaths are on the rise. They initially believed that the accidents might involve mostly young Marines and sailors about 18 or 19 years old. But Navy statistics show that five of the victims were 25, the most prevalent of any age involved in the crashes. And two 40-year-old sailors were killed in motorcycle crashes.\n\nAmos said the Marines have seen a similar trend.\n\nBut he says the new training seems to be working: Of the 300 young men and women who have gone through the sport-bike course, only three have had accidents.\n\nThe safety course instructors said some Marines who go through the training decide the sport bike is not for them.\n\nBut even some Marines who've survived past crashes still want to ride again, even after they get the new training.\n\n\"I enjoy it,\" said Tucker. \"I can actually get on my motorcycle and ride, and it's just like if I were to do bowling or rock climbing or scuba diving. It's something for me. It relaxes me.\"\n\n@highlight\n\n25 Marines killed on motorcycles in past 12 months, compared with 20 killed in Iraq\n\n@highlight\n\nTop Marine official: \"The Marines are very serious about\" addressing problem\n\n@highlight\n\nAll but one of the deaths have involved super-fast sport bikes\n\n@highlight\n\nMarines have recently implemented a mandatory sport-bike course", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 28, "text": "Motorcycle accidents"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What have most of the deaths involved?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a0cc5af0b33ae00ac9073d67534c2954bc4082db.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 612, "text": "ths"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What number of marines have been killed?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a0cc5af0b33ae00ac9073d67534c2954bc4082db.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2168, "text": "g course specifically designed"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did the Marines recently implement?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a0cc5af0b33ae00ac9073d67534c2954bc4082db.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 348, "text": "ty-five Mari"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many marines were killed on motorcycles?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a0cc5af0b33ae00ac9073d67534c2954bc4082db.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 448, "text": "t bike"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What kind of bikes were involved?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a0cc5af0b33ae00ac9073d67534c2954bc4082db.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 348, "text": "ty-five Mari"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many Marines were killed on motorcycles in Iraq?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a0cc5af0b33ae00ac9073d67534c2954bc4082db.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2119, "text": "course.

Still, many travelers were stunned Tuesday to learn that the carrier and its parent company have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nAmerican, American Eagle and all other subsidiaries will honor all tickets and reservations and operate normal flight schedules during the bankruptcy filing process.\n\nCNN airline and aviation correspondent Richard Quest weighed in on some of the basic questions about the airline's decision.\n\nWhy has American Airlines decided to make this move?\n\nRichard Quest: They're doing it for one simple reason: The American Airlines cost base is considerably higher than United, Continental, and Delta, which merged with Northwest. Those other airlines did go through Chapter 11 during (past) recessions and they managed to slash their costs.\n\nSo now American has been struggling for the last few years trying to negotiate, trying to get agreements, trying to get its costs down.\n\nBut frankly, with oil prices high, with growth slowing down, and with so many other competitive disadvantages, incoming CEO Thomas Horton told me a short while ago they really had no choice. It was time to push the nuclear button.\n\nThere's no doubt it is a dramatic development for a company that has several billions of dollars in cash. It has good strong hubs.\n\nAll in all, this is being done purely and simply not because American is going bankrupt -- the planes are still flying, the champagne is still being served in first class, all things will be normal -- it's being done to get down the costs.\n\nIf I have a ticket now or for six months from now, should I be worried?\n\nQuest: There is no danger that American Airlines is going to stop flying. Let's be absolutely crystal clear about that.\n\nFor the traveling public, this has absolutely no effect.\n\nI think many travelers are used to this. They flew United in Chapter 11, they flew Delta, US Airways and all the others in Chapter 11 during those times.\n\nHorton told me he hopes the Chapter 11 will last less time than the others, the average being 16 months.\n\nIf you're flying American, don't worry\n\nAre any changes coming to the airline?\n\nQuest: The people who I think perhaps will be watching and be concerned are American's employees.

At 1,000 megawatts, Bushehr will be able to provide 2.5% of Iran's current electricity consumption, the IAEA said.\n\nAbbasi made the announcement about Bushehr while attending a meeting on Iran's nuclear achievements held in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\nHe told the meeting that Tehran had shown the new generation of its homemade centrifuge machines to the IAEA \"in a bid to demonstrate the ability of Iranian scientists,\" he said.\n\nAbbasi said the centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, were shown to the deputy of IAEA, Director-General Yukiya Amano, but he did not say when.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether an IAEA representative had in fact been to Iran and seen the centrifuges.\n\nThe new centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium over the current purity level of 5%, according to experts cited by the news agency.\n\nUranium enriched to between 3% and 5% is necessary to make fuel for reactors. Uranium enriched to 93.5% is considered weapons-grade.\n\nThe construction of Bushehr -- a civilian, not military, plant -- started in 1975 when Germany signed a contract with Iran. Germany, however, pulled out of the project following the 1979 revolution that created the current Islamic republic.\n\nIran then signed a deal with Russia in 1995, under which the plant was originally scheduled to be completed in 1999, but the project was delayed repeatedly. Bushehr finally opened in August 2010.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations have expressed concerns that Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology mean it is developing a nuclear program for military purposes.\n\nThe IAEA said in a November report that it has \"serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions\" to Iran's nuclear program. The agency said it has information indicating Iran has carried out \"activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.\"\n\nIran has denied such allegations, saying the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under IAEA supervision.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the concern is not the Bushehr plant, but other nuclear facilities like Natanz, in the middle of the country; a facility at Qom, south of Tehran; \"and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nBushehr plant will reach full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by February 1, IRNA reports\n\n@highlight\n\nIran's nuclear chief claims the centrifuges have been shown to an IAEA representative\n\n@highlight\n\nIRNA cites experts who say centrifuges will be able to enrich uranium beyond 5% purity\n\n@highlight\n\nUranium enriched to 93.5% is considered weapons-grade", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 468, "text": "uary 1, Abba"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When will the plant reach full capacity?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1111, "text": "the cen"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who believes that iran will be able to enrich uranium beyond 5% purity?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Did the IAEA representative confirm that they had seen the centrifuges?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 285, "text": "a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\\n\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who were shown the centrifuges?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 449, "text": "0 megawatts by F"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is Bushehr's plants full capacity?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 449, "text": "0 megawatts by F"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the full capacity of the plant?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1607, "text": "o 93.5% is considered weap"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is considered to be weapons grade?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f9bfccdbd134fe2e2984b5596fdaff0a84fc61d3.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/0fb99dfede4fad1238d2728c406acc2f85e84b23.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- For Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, the last two months have been a whirlwind. \"Full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life,\" says the 24-year-old Olympic swimmer.\n\nEric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer.\n\n\"Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team. That's where I want to be'.\"\n\nIn June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer. \"My initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else,\" he says. \"I'm used to being in control of everything. I'm in control of how I train, how I race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough.\"\n\nAfter weeks of tests to determine the \"stage\" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment. Though putting off the surgery was controversial to some, Eric says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations. \"I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn't have put off having surgery.\"  Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports from Eric Shanteau's surgery »\n\nHe swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke. He did not qualify for the finals.\n\nCancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition. He put everything he had into that heat. \"Leave it all in the pool, and I don't look back and regret anything as far as how I raced.\"\n\nOnce back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia. Though admittedly a little scared, he spent the evening relaxing with his family, cooking dinner, walking the dog.\n\nA source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer.\n\n\"They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world,\" says Shanteau. \"They all affect me in a different way and it's been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people.\"\n\nTesticular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer for 15- to 34-year-olds. It is also one of the most curable if discovered early. Nearly 140,000 men in the United States are testicular cancer survivors.\n\nShanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance. \"I've been in a Speedo half my life,\" he says. \"So I am really comfortable with my body. One day I just felt something that wasn't suppose to be there. I decided to go and get it checked out.\"\n\nHe adds that although he had the \"greatest excuse in the world\" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection. Shanteau's father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment.\n\n\"A lot of guys, if they hear a rattle in their car, they're at the mechanic the next day,\" he says. \"But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart. There's really no excuse, because it can save your life.\"\n\nFast forward to Shanteau's recent operation at Emory University Hospital. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was with Shanteau during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeff Carney, moments afterward.\n\n\"I think the operation went very well,\" Carney said. \"Eric's a very healthy young man, very thin, in excellent shape. That makes my job easy.\"\n\nLater that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer. \"The majority of it is gone.\" he tells CNN. \"There is a small chance it could come back but I shouldn't need chemotherapy at this point, so I am really optimistic.\"\n\nHis treatment plan is to keep a close eye on his health for the next year with regular medical tests. \"Obviously, it would have been nice if the doctor said, 'You're completely in the clear,' but my results are exactly what the doctors expected.\"\n\nEric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life. \"I appreciate life much more now,\" he says. \"I don't let myself get upset about the little nitpicky things anymore.

On Friday, the Carnival cruise ship Elation, sponsored by the world's largest nonprofit singles travel group, will make history by hosting the world's first International Cougar Cruise, and we don't mean the animal.\n\nDefined by the Urban Dictionary, a cougar is \"an older woman who frequents clubs in order to score with a much younger man.\" It can be anyone from \"an overly surgically altered wind tunnel victim, to an absolute sad and bloated old horn-meister.\"\n\n\"A cougar is generally known as a woman over 40 who likes to date younger men, but theoretically any woman who dates younger men is a cougar,\" said Rich Gosse, who came up with the cougar cruise idea.\n\nThe ship, which sets sail from San Diego, California, to Ensenada, Mexico, for three nights, is booked for 300 guests and even has a waiting list. The ship has three swimming pools, a seven-deck-high atrium, bar and grill, a Moroccan-inspired Casablanca Casino and a lounge that features stage shows, according to Ann Thomas, owner of the Singles Travel Company and organizer of the Cougar Cruise.\n\nAfter making port in Ensenada, the cruise offers extracurricular activities like horseback riding, ATVing and other outdoor excursions.\n\n\"There's at least four or five options a day for people to get together on the cruise. We're doing lots of activities; dancing, dining, Jacuzzi parties, karaoke for two hours. And starting at $125 a ticket, it's a great price,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"I've had to hire two more people part-time just to pick up the phones,\" she said. \"I've never seen a response quite like this.\"\n\nThomas admits that she was hesitant to sign on to the idea but is glad she did.\n\n\"We have people flying in from Italy and Denmark. My associates have been booking from France, Canada. It's fascinating,\" Thomas said.\n\nGosse, who has been hosting singles events for more than 30 years, said he got the idea after hosting a cougar convention in Palo Alto, California.\n\n\"We had to turn away hundreds of people,\" Gosse said. \"Then we did one in Beverly Hills and had a massive crowd down there, so I thought, maybe we should do a cougar cruise. I didn't think anyone would want to go. Needless to say, the phone is ringing off the hook.\"\n\nThese cougars may as well be an endangered species compared with those hunting them on this cruise.\n\n\"The basic problem is, we have is too many cubs,\" Gosse said. \"We usually have too many women and not enough guys, but there's been a paradigm shift in recent years, so now the cubs are more excited about it than the cougars.\"\n\nA \"cub\" is someone in their 20s or early 30s who likes to date older women, according to Gosse.\n\nFor years, he says, it's been socially acceptable for older men to date younger women. But in recent years, a phenomenon sparked by celebrities like Kutcher, baseball player Alex Rodriguez (who is said to have dated pop star Madonna) and others has led a new generation of younger men on the prowl for more experienced partners.\n\nThere is even an ABC sitcom called \"Cougar Town\" that glamorizes the sexual escapades of a 40-something divorcee on a search for self-discovery by dating younger men.\n\n\"Tim Robbins [and] Susan Sarandon was the first high-profile cougar-cub relationship,\" Gosse said of the actors, who have been together since the late 1980s. \"Now we're seeing a paradigm shift where these younger guys are actively looking for older women.\"\n\n\"If you look at the demographics, the only logical way for people to get their needs met is for younger men to date older women,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, for every 100 single women in their 20s in America, there are 118 single men in their 20s. The reason, Gosse said, is that young women are dating older guys.\n\n\"When you're single, you always wish the person meets someone they want to be with. If this is something they want, then I wish them well,\" Thomas said.\n\n@highlight\n\nCruise for women who date younger men sets sail on Carnival cruise ship Elation\n\n@highlight\n\nThe event is fully booked at 300 travelers, organizers say\n\n@highlight\n\nCruise is one of many symbols of burgeoning \"cougar\" movement", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 78, "text": "Friday,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "when will the cruise for women sets sail?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 111, "text": "Elation,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the name of the cruise ship?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 218, "text": "world's first International"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "cruise is a symbol of which cougar movement?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 861, "text": "ests"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "the event is fully booked by how many travelers?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 111, "text": "Elation,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the name of the Carnival ship?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 861, "text": "ests"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many travelers are there?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 861, "text": "ests and ev"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many people have booked this cruise?", "id": "./cnn/stories/e8f395b6cddae07589733c35b40fd0ad482ce421.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/34a976e6ff2a6c5cf3d4262b142413a7d1bca2d7.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report.\n\nAmericans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice.\n\nRising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility.\n\n\"It's temporary, but real,\" said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. \"As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work.\"\n\nThe institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007.\n\nThe organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by \"every measure, congestion has increased substantially\" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007.\n\nResearchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline.\n\nCongestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a \"rare break in near-constant growth,\" the report said.\n\nBecause the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said.\n\n\"Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice,\" Fette said.\n\nAmong the report's other findings:\n\n• American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler.\n\n• The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person.\n\n• The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks' worth of gas, for every traveler.\n\nCongestion has slowed but, said the report's authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, \"hardly a positive goal statement.\"\n\nThe Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said.\n\nThat means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer.\n\nCNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nTransportation

Drivers are choosing to keep their old cars longer, and often they're willing to put in the money to do so, observers say.\n\nThe Automotive Service Association reports their members' sales were up 16 percent over last year.  Watch Kate Bolduan's report on the thriving auto repair industry »\n\n\"That indicated that people were coming in and putting the vehicle in the repair facilities' hands and saying, 'Look, I am going to be keeping this car. I want to be sure it runs well. I want to be sure that if there are any safety issues or any maintenance issues that I have overlooked, let's get those taken care of,' \" said ASA President Ron Pyle.\n\nPyle said that's a change from the past, when drivers would scrimp on the cost of maintenance and repair.\n\n\"That was surprising news. We didn't expect that in the midst of the beginnings of the economic woes,\" Pyle said. \"But they are looking at the cost of trying to purchase a new vehicle ... so I think that in relative terms that $1,000 repair to keep a $2,500 car running may be an attractive alternative.\"\n\nThe economic slump has cut automakers deeply. Last month, sales of new cars were down more than 40 percent compared with the same time last year, according to sales tracker Autodata.\n\nThe trend seems to have translated into increased traffic at auto parts stores.\n\n\"We're doing way more business. The phones are ringing, you know, customers are walking in,\" said Darryl Wright, owner of D.C. Brake & Bearings Co. \"Basically, if it's broke, they fix it.\"\n\nIn the past, only savvy auto mechanics knew to shop at Wright's nondescript discount store. Now, he sees more car owners who are looking for a cheaper deal on parts.\n\n\"[Customers will] find a guy on the street, you know -- Joe Shady Mechanics is what we call them -- to fix it at a deeper discount rate, labor-wise, and they'll send the customer in here to buy the parts on their own,\" Wright said. \"So people are saving money that way too.\"\n\nSrisook said he keeps service prices low to appeal to those bargain shoppers, such as Esther White, a loyal customer. She brought in her daughter's 1996 Oldsmobile for new rotors and brakes, and said her daughter would be driving the car \"until it drops dead.\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, we were raised to fix things, and to hold on to things as long as we could,\" White said. \"But it goes back to today's economy, and making the right financial decisions.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nAs more strapped Americans opt to fix their cars, repair shops are doing well\n\n@highlight\n\nAutomotive Service Association: Members' sales grew 16 percent over the last year\n\n@highlight\n\nD.C. shop owner: \"People are willing to spend more\" to keep cars well-serviced\n\n@highlight\n\nTrend seems to have translated into increased traffic at auto parts stores, as well", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 323, "text": "Srisook"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who grew sales?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ee562c81df68ecb43c04d398e2ab5c9ad4786c5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 776, "text": "do-it-yourself projects and bargain shopping,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are Americans doing?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ee562c81df68ecb43c04d398e2ab5c9ad4786c5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 572, "text": "Srisook"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who said that people were willing to spend more?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ee562c81df68ecb43c04d398e2ab5c9ad4786c5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2170, "text": "increased traffic at auto parts stores.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What has the trend created?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ee562c81df68ecb43c04d398e2ab5c9ad4786c5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2191, "text": "auto parts"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What stores show increased traffic?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ee562c81df68ecb43c04d398e2ab5c9ad4786c5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 202, "text": "cars"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are Americans opting to fix?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9ee562c81df68ecb43c04d398e2ab5c9ad4786c5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2213, "text": "\"We're doing way more business.

Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit.\n\nG-8 leaders wait for an aide to remove toe markers as they pose for a family photo in L'Aquila, Italy, on July 8.\n\nThe G-8 countries -- comprising the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia -- agreed to a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050 to try to prevent the Earth's atmosphere from warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Obama said.\n\nThursday's meeting with emerging economies including China also secured a commitment from the developing countries to work for limiting global warming to the 2 degree Celsius threshold, Obama said.\n\n\"Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the midterm, in the context of sustainable development, supported by financing, technology, and capacity-building,\" said the declaration from Thursday's Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate.\n\nThe declaration stopped short of setting targets for the developing nations. Obama said the emerging economies agreed to work toward setting specific targets.  Watch report from CNN's Ed Henry »\n\nHe called the commitment of the emerging economies \"an important stride forward\" in minimizing climate change, but acknowledged that the issue he called one of the most challenging of our times would be difficult to confront.\n\nEnvironment groups gave the announcement a cautious welcome. Joanne Green, head of policy at Cafod, told the Press Association: \"Agreeing that average global temperatures should not rise by more than two degrees is forward movement but it is woefully inadequate compared to what was needed.\"\n\nAnd Oxfam spokesman Antonio Hill said: \"Today 17 countries, responsible for more than 80 percent of the world's emissions, agreed for the first time that it'd be nice to take the road which stops the planet heating up by more than 2 degrees.\n\n\"While G-8 countries continue to speed in the opposite direction, towards a cooked planet and climate catastrophe, poor people want to know whether rich coutries will now actually turn around before it's too late.\"\n\nThe vast majority of climate change scientists warn that warming above the 2 degree Celsius threshold would mean potentially catastrophic impacts on Earth.\n\nU.N.-led negotiations on a new global climate change treaty are aiming to conclude with an agreement among 192 nations in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.\n\nIn the United States, Congress is debating a new energy policy that could codify the G-8 target for emissions reductions in law. A House bill that recently passed has the same target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050, but Senate passage of a measure remains uncertain.  Watch as leaders tour quake zone »\n\nRepublican opponents contend the United States would put itself at a competitive disadvantage by setting firm targets when China and other emerging economies would be free to pollute without limits. Some Democratic senators also fear harmful effects on fossil fuel industries in their states.\n\nThe Major Economies Forum led by Obama included the G-8 countries along with Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Australia, South Africa and others. The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIts declaration Thursday outlined a range of actions including funding mechanisms for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping nations and ecosystems adapt to global warming, along with more money to pursue alternative energy sources.\n\nThe declaration said the world's emissions should peak as soon as possible and then start going down. It acknowledged that industrial powers have emitted most of the pollution causing climate change and therefore have a greater responsibility in responding.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the creation of an institute to study and advance so-called clean coal technology intended to reduce the harmful pollution from coal-fired energy.\n\nIn addition, the declaration recognized \"that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries, bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities in developing countries and that low-carbon development is indispensable to sustainable development.\"  Watch what's on agenda at G-8 summit »\n\nTodd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels. He called those steps \"significant,\" but conceded they fell short of binding commitments to meet specific reductions goals.\n\nHowever, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the \"underpinning\" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries.\n\nObama acknowledged the United States has previously failed to meet its responsibilities regarding climate change, and he pledged a renewed commitment and leadership. In his remarks, Rudd made a point of welcoming the new leadership role by Obama and the United States.\n\nObama will meet Friday with Pope Benedict XVI, who launched a verbal assault on global capitalism ahead of the G-8 meeting, lambasting \"grave deviations and failures\" and calling for a \"profoundly new way of understanding business enterprise.\"\n\nThe pope challenged bankers to turn away from the practices blamed for bringing about the global economic crisis and instead use their power to help the world create wealth and economic development.\n\n\"Above all, the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods,\" Benedict said Wednesday.\n\nAfter his meeting with the pope, the first U.S. African-American president will make his first trip as chief executive to Africa, traveling to Accra, Ghana.

The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said.\n\nHe said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia's Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail.\n\nShabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle.\n\nBut this edict could be bolstered by Somalia's parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia.\n\nSomali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament's vote \"removed any justifications for any opposition group ... to use Islam for political ends.\"\n\nThere are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television.\n\nLast week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons.\n\nSharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\n\"People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn't the case,\" the prime minister said. \"I think sharia in Somalia is part of the laws for thousands of years, and we never had this kind of a thing. Besides, it doesn't have to be that way, cutting hands.\"\n\nUnder some strict interpretations of sharia, a thief is punished by having a hand cut off.\n\nAl-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006.

Henry Waxman says the State Department is covering up \"an epidemic of corruption\" in Iraq.\n\nThe report comes alongside Rep. Henry Waxman's warning of a \"confrontation\" with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over how much Americans should be able to learn about corruption in Iraq.\n\nIn a sharply worded letter,  Waxman demanded Rice turn over a long list of documents related to the contractor, Andrew Moonen.\n\n\"Serious questions now exist about whether the State Department may have withheld from the U.S. Defense Department facts about this Blackwater contractor's shooting of the Iraqi guard that should have prevented his hiring to work on another contract in support of the Iraq War,\" wrote Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nMoonen is accused of fatally shooting an Iraqi guard and fleeing the scene, according to a Congressional memo describing the investigation report. He was fined, fired and flown home from Iraq, and the company later paid $20,000 in compensation to the victim's family.  Moonen returned to the United States within a few days of the incident, his attorney said, but in February he returned to Kuwait working for Combat Support Associates (CSA), a company spokesman said.\n\nCNN reported Thursday night that CSA said it was unaware of the December incident when it hired Moonen, because the State Department and Blackwater kept the incident quiet and out of Moonen's personnel records.  Waxman wrote it is \"hard to reconcile this development\" with previous assertions State Department officials have made in recent days.   Waxman earlier accused Rice and the State Department of a cover-up of what he called \"an epidemic of corruption\" in Iraq in general.\n\nHe branded the State Department's anti-corruption efforts \"dysfunctional, under-funded and a low priority.\"\n\nWaxman further blasted the department for trying to keep secret details of corruption in Iraq, especially relating to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.\n\n\"Corruption is increasing in Iraq, and the State Department can't keep us from knowing that -- can't censor that -- just because it might embarrass or hurt our relationship with [al-]Maliki,\" Waxman said at the House committee hearing.  Watch Waxman ask why negative comments must be said behind closed doors »\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Larry Butler repeatedly refused to answer questions from Waxman about Iraqi corruption but offered full disclosure if his testimony would be kept secret.\n\nAsked if he believes the Iraqi government has the political will or the capability to root out corruption, Butler responded, \"Mr. Chairman, questions which go to the broad nature of our bilateral relationship with Iraq are best answered in a classified setting.\"\n\nBut he was more forthcoming when talking about efforts that al-Maliki has taken to improve matters, commending the prime minister for dispatching Iraqi forces to surround a refinery to ensure oil did not end up on the black market.\n\nBut Waxman appeared unmoved.\n\n\"Why can you talk about the positive things and not the negative things?\" he asked. \"Shouldn't we have the whole picture?\"\n\n\"I'd be very pleased to answer those questions in an appropriate setting,\" Butler replied.\n\nWaxman laughed and asked, \"An appropriate setting for positive things is a congressional hearing, but for negative things, it must be behind closed doors?\"\n\n\"As you know, this goes to the very heart of diplomatic relations and national security,\" Butler said.\n\n\"It goes to the very heart of propaganda,\" Waxman said, putting funding for anti-corruption activities through June 15, 2006, at $65 million, \"or less than 0.003 percent of the total\" spent by the Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n\nThe State Department said details of anti-corruption efforts must be secret to protect investigators and Iraqi allies.\n\nIn a letter to Rice last week, Waxman called the department's position \"ludicrous.\"\n\nFellow Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky agreed. \"It's pretty clear that the administration just wants to muzzle any comments that reflect negatively on the [al-]Maliki government,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, the former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, told the hearing that al-Maliki had protected family members from corruption investigations, citing Salam al-Maliki, Iraq's former transportation minister and the prime minister's cousin.\n\nAl-Radhi resigned last month and fled Iraq after he and his family were attacked and 31 of his anti-corruption employees were killed. He said corruption has affected \"virtually every agency and ministry, including some of the most powerful officials in Iraq.\"\n\n\"Corruption has stopped possible advances by the government on the political level, on economic reconstruction, on basic services, amenities and infrastructure and on the rule of law,\" he told the committee, estimating the total lost to corruption at $18 billion.\n\nIn Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh acknowledged his country is plagued with a \"high level\" of corruption, but he said officials are trying to rein in the problem.\n\nU.S. Comptroller General David Walker, head of the Government Accountability Office, said there appeared to be no U.S. plan for countering the corruption. He urged Congress to consider conditioning future appropriations on such a plan \"so we can achieve some results rather than have just more efforts.\"\n\nWaxman questioned whether Iraq's government was \"too corrupt to succeed.\" If so, he added, \"We need to ask if we could, in good conscience, continue to ... prop up his regime.\" E-mail to a friend\n\nCNN's Bob Constantini contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nNEW: Rep.

It's through his bloodline that we're related.\"\n\nDean claims to be a third cousin five times removed.\n\n\"There were three brothers that came to America from England in 1635,\" he says. \"We're related to Samuel Lincoln, the same one Abraham Lincoln is related to.\"\n\n\"I'm tall and fairly thin,\" Dean adds. \"He didn't have a moustache. If I shaved and grew a beard like him, I'd probably look a lot like him.\"\n\nDean's son, Abraham, looks more like his mother.\n\n\"I got the color of my skin from my mother, the Hispanic side,\" Abraham says. \"I have the height from my dad, similar to Abraham Lincoln's height -- though not quite there, three inches shorter.\"  Watch Abraham Lincoln speak of his iconic namesake »\n\nKryssia, Abraham's mother, is from El Salvador.\n\n\"I loved the name Abraham,\" she says. \"I always did. I think it sounds so elegant and in Spanish, it's 'Aab-ra-haam'. In the Bible, Abraham is the 'father of our faith.' \"\n\n\"I never knew I was going to marry a man with the last name 'Lincoln,' never dreamed about it. So when I got married (in 1982) to my husband, Dean Lincoln, and we had our second child, and it was a boy,\" she says, snapping her fingers, \"sure enough, I wanted to name him Abraham.\n\n\"We didn't have to argue very much because of course the heritage that he has ... and his great-grandfather's name was Abraham.\"  See photos of the Lincolns »\n\nAt the Lincolns' home in Everett, Washington, the dining room table is full of genealogy lists, old family photos and letters, some dating back to the Civil War.\n\nDean carefully unfolds one of the letters. It's from William Lincoln, a Union soldier and Dean's great-great-great-grandfather.\n\n\"The 'Rebs' are getting just where ol' Sherman wants them,\" William Lincoln wrote home to his wife. \"He will rout them soon and drive them back to their holes.\"\n\n\"We ain't heard from the election to any certainty yet. But the soldiers think, if Lincoln is elected, we have hopes of the war playing out.\"\n\nOf his famous name, Abraham says, \"At first, people don't believe me. I usually have to pull out my driver's license. They'll usually crack a few jokes ... sort of breaks the ice.\"\n\n\"Once in school, a teacher came to my name in roll call. He decided to stop the class and told me to 'make sure I never drive a Ford car.' 'Don't ever let my wife convince me to go to a theater.'\n\n\"He asked if I knew John Wilkes Booth. Those are the most common ones. I think he was waiting to get a reaction outta me, but I told him that I'd heard them before.\"\n\nWord spread quickly through his high school that this freshman wanted to be called \"Mr. Prez.\" The nickname stuck. And because of his Hispanic roots, some of his classmates even called him \"El Presidente.\"\n\n\"I think I've heard every one in the book. I still get a chuckle every time someone thinks they've come up with a new one,\" Abraham says.\n\nAbraham grew up in Everett, where, coincidentally, the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is based. When he was 16, the local newspaper asked if he would write a letter to crew members returning from a mission to Iraq.\n\nAbraham's letter read, in part:\n\n\"Dear Lincoln crew,\n\n\"My name is Abraham Lincoln. I want to thank you for making me proud to know that the men and women on board the Abraham Lincoln, a ship with the same name as me, are out there fighting as true American heroes.\"\n\nAt first, Abraham had no desire to walk in the shadow of such a great leader. Then, at the University of Washington, he took a political science class.\n\n\"There was something about politics that drew me,\" he says. \"I loved the history behind it. That's when I made up my own mind: That was the path I wanted to go.\"\n\nAbraham spent a semester in Washington, D.C., as an intern for former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts. On his list of places to visit? The Lincoln Memorial and Ford's Theatre.\n\n\"The whole atmosphere of that city, knowing someone I was related to, a descendant of mine, had such a huge impact and changed the world as we know it ... And to have a huge memorial dedicated to such a great president.\"\n\nThis past summer, Abraham married Jenae, whom he met as a church youth leader. He says she likes the history behind the name and the attention they receive.\n\nAbe is working as a paralegal. He wants to attend law school and -- you guessed it -- pursue a career in public service or politics.\n\n\"If anything, President Abraham Lincoln is a great model to follow after. So if you have the name, might as well go down the same path.\"\n\nOf the similarities between Presidents Lincoln and Obama, Abraham says, \"Lincoln came into office with a nation divided in the Civil War, and Obama is the first African-American president, hoping to transcend party lines dividing America.\"\n\nSince Abraham's birthday comes eight days after his famous namesake's, the Lincoln family will celebrate President Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday together with their own son's birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, Dean is growing a beard again. Kryssia wants him to shave the mustache and don a suit to honor President Lincoln's birthday\n\nShe says of her son: \"No, I don't think he looks like Abraham Lincoln, the president. But he has the name and he serves well the name ... And I think there's a future for my son.\n\n\"I just know in my heart he will keep honoring that name.

degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, peaking global green house gas emissions by 2015.\n\nBriefing reporters after the conference, the Bangladesh state minister for environment and forests, Dr. Hasan Mahmud, said, \"We have decided to raise our voice together on various contentious issues in Durban\".\n\nThe declaration said climate change induced displacement of people has become a major concern, and the relocation and rehabilitation of those people is putting enormous pressure on infrastructures and service facilities, as well as causing tremendous social stresses.\n\nIt said

are only for energy purposes -- \"purely a fabrication by the United States,\" according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\n\"This is something that is in the doctrine of anti-Iranianism, since the policy and the 30-year-old history of the Islamic Republic has proven that Iran wants to live in peace and under the spirit of equality and fraternity, with its Muslim neighbors and the rest of the world,\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said.\n\nOn Thursday, President Obama said the United States is significantly overhauling Bush-era plans for a missile defense shield in Europe, based partly on the latest analysis of Iran's offensive capabilities.\n\nThe \"new missile defense architecture in Europe\" will be ready faster, work with existing technology and provide better missile defense than the program proposed by former President George W. Bush, Obama said.\n\nObama said the change of gears was based on an \"updated intelligence assessment\" about Iran's ability to hit Europe with missiles. The Islamic republic's \"short- and medium-range\" missiles pose the most current threat, he said, and \"this new ballistic missile defense will best address\" that threat.\n\nKhamenei, speaking on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, a festive end to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, countered by comparing Obama to his predecessor.\n\n\"America, under its former president, spared no efforts against the Muslim world as well as against Iran,\" Khamenei said. \"Even the current administration -- with the apparently friendly words and messages -- follows that same anti-Islamic and anti-Iranian policy of the past.\"\n\nThe Bush-era proposal called for the United States to set up a radar site in the Czech Republic and 10 missile interceptors in Poland to counter the threat of Iran launching long-range missiles at America's allies in Europe.

Much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum, copper, cadmium and other minerals, all of which can be sold on, if they can be recovered.\n\nHowever they also contain highly toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers.\n\n\"People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children,\" Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN.\n\n\"The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins.\"\n\nNo studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon.\n\nA Chinese academic report published in \"Environmental Health Perspectives\" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for \"e-waste\" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\n\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\n\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, \"Not in My Backyard\", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\n\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\n\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\n\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\n\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\n\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\n\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\n\n\"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,\" said Schoppink.\n\n\"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem.\n\n\"The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it. The export of e-waste from the EU is illegal under the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipment Directive, but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented. In the U.S., there is no such law banning this practice.\n\n\"In Nigeria the government is talking about stopping imports, but there has been no progress on this to date.\"\n\nSigns of progress\n\nThere are calls from environmental groups likes Greenpeace for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances, and there are some signs of progress.\n\nSeveral electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances, and others, including Nokia, Philips and Samsung are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to. Apple claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals.\n\n\"If producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products, e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries,\" said Schoppink.\n\n\"The pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow.\"\n\nBut while the developing world needs the U.S. and EU to take responsibility for their waste, it also needs their discarded computers to train and build a 21st century workforce.\n\n\"Nobody is arguing that Africa should be denied access to computers,\" said Tony Roberts, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Computer Aid International, a charity licensed by the UK Environment Agency, which provides recycled computers to developing countries to improve education and healthcare.\n\n\"Technical colleges and universities are always short of resources. It is, of course, essential to developing economies escaping poverty to have access to affordable modern technology.\"\n\nComputer Aid works to close the digital divide between the north and southern hemispheres and offers corporations, including Coca Cola, as well as individuals, a positive way of disposing of electronics. They also believe learning about responsibility for that technology is a crucial part of the exchange.\n\n\"Computer Aid argues that, in addition to the PCs, it is essential to also build the skills, knowledge and operating capacity in every country to manage responsible re-use programs and environmentally sound end-of-life recycling.\"\n\nIn the end, this is about everyone involved -- particularly the developed nations -- taking responsibility for their waste.\n\n\"It is clear that companies have a moral obligation to treat Africa in exactly the same way that they do, say, Germany,\" said Roberts. Until then, toxic black smoke will continue to cast a shadow over lives across the developing world.\n\n@highlight\n\nExport of electronic products for recycling creating health and environment problems\n\n@highlight\n\nDeveloped nations that export e-waste criticized by many for lack of responsibility\n\n@highlight\n\nStudy from Greenpeace suggest only around 20 percent recycled safely\n\n@highlight\n\nOrganized crime involved in e-waste trading according to UN report in July", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3171, "text": "criminal gangs"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was involved in e-waste trading according to UN report in July?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 210, "text": "Toxins from dumped electronics"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is creating health and environment problems?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 7059, "text": "the developed nations"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who was criticized by many for lack of responsibility?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What kind of problems is exporting electronic problems for recycling creating?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who is being criticized and why?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 210, "text": "Toxins from dumped electronics"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What have developed nations been criticized for?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1278, "text": "high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does the study from Greenpeace suggest?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What percentage of people recycled safely?", "id": "./cnn/stories/c38cbaa56e0652695ec6cac676366a38450cfdd0.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a313d568a85d4ac29024718d9998b40a94a56026.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Burberry, the 150-year-old British luxury brand most famous for its distinctive check pattern, has recently experienced a resurgence.\n\nChristopher Bailey, Burberry's creative director, has been credited with the brand's resurgence.\n\nThe brand credits much of its new a la mode image to creative director Christopher Bailey.\n\nThe unassuming 37-year-old British designer has successfully reconnected Burberry with a trendy young audience -- using the likes of British super model Agyness Deyn, whom he has propelled to international stardom -- in ad campaigns.\n\nBut times are hard for luxury brands, with a recession that has turned many high-end consumers toward cheaper alternatives.\n\nSo how is Bailey handling the current economic climate?\n\nWith stylish new headquarters in the heart of London and the recent opening of a Burberry Children's wear store in the capital, it seems the brand has kept its wheels rolling.

Within seconds, the players dip and dive like dolphins until one player stands alone, relishing in victory.\n\nAn adult plays in a dodge ball league organized by the \nCity of Sparks Parks and Recreation in Nevada.\n\nIt's the classic game of dodge ball, but these aren't fifth-graders during PE class in Sparks, Nevada.\n\nThe childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their 20s and 30s -- and even a few players who reached retirement.\n\nNow, hundreds of working professionals, doctors, lawyers and teachers congregate at the local recreation center for a dose of dodge ball on Sunday nights.\n\n\"I think a lot of it goes back to trying to stay young,\" said Tony Pehle, recreation supervisor in Sparks, who started the dodge ball program after being inspired by the 2004 Ben Stiller movie \"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.\"\n\n\"They might be adults, but they still like to play and have fun.\"\n\nHas Peter Pan syndrome come to stay? From playing dodge ball to jumping double Dutch and competing in rock-paper-scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be child's play.\n\nThe 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest in Orlando, Florida, this weekend (August 13)  is all grown up, attracting more than 150 adult competitors, who can showcase dizzying tricks with the flick of a finger. Later in the month, hundreds of adults outfitted in pirate and animal costumes will race their homebuilt vehicles for Oregon's annual Portland Adult Soapbox Derby, a crafty activity that began for youths in the 1930s.\n\n\"Once a year, I get to build something for the kid in me,\" says Jason Hogue, a 41-year-old carpenter, who has participated in the race for eight years. Last year, he constructed a car shaped like a hammerhead shark. \"We get to use our creativity and get excited with our friends.\"\n\nWhether they're done to seek refuge from the daily grind or to provide nostalgia for youthful days -- or they're a product of what some experts say is a generation that can't grow up -- these juvenile pastimes are getting more popular. For example, adult viewership of the Nickelodeon show \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" swelled by 51 percent from 1999 to 2009, officials say.\n\nThe World Adult Kickball Association, one of the largest kickball organizations, has spread its tentacles to 33 states as well a soldier division in Iraq. WAKA Kickball began as a casual game between a few young single friends in their 20s in Washington, D.C. Now, the games appeal to tens of thousands of adults, many of them yuppies wanting a quick escape from the stresses of their first 401(k), mortgage and job.\n\n\"I played soccer growing up, and I like competition,\" says avid kickball player Marlon LeWinter, 28, of New York City. LeWinter, a public relations executive, usually plays the position of center with a bunch of producers, writers and analysts in their late 20s. They named their team Chipwich Nation after they scarfed down the cookies-and-ice cream treat at a bar after a game one night.\n\n\"Sometimes when it's [the score] two to one in a kickball came, I get the jitters,\" he says.\n\nThe economic bind also creates a favorable environment for adults to latch onto simple children's games and sports. With players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children. They can make new friends and go for a beer after the game. These activities are also budget-friendly, costing less than $100 to join for several months of play -- much less than a golf club membership.\n\nSince the recession, Duncan Toys, one of the biggest yo-yo manufacturers in the United States, has seen sales spike. A company official noticed many of the adults who purchased yo-yos tried to get the same models they owned as kids.\n\n\"Nowadays, everything is taken so seriously that people revert to something like playing with a yo-yo,\" says Mike McBride, a 34-year-old multimedia designer who picked up the activity shortly after college. McBride, who will compete in the Orlando World Yo-Yo contest, says the activity helps him relieve stress. \"There's no pressure.\"\n\nIn 2006, Christopher Noxon, in his book \"Rejuvenile,\" explored why adults fancy childhood pursuits like kickball, cartoons and cupcakes. Beginning with Generation X adults in the 1990s, the group began to shift from the norms of the hierarchal corporate ladder, and the age of marriage began to steadily climb.\n\nSoon, juvenile activities that had been regarded as silly became hip. Quirky became cool, and more organized teams, groups and competitions for playground sports and childlike hobbies emerged.\n\n\"Our whole idea of adulthood has changed,\" says Noxon. \"We value flexibility and creativity, and these are things kids are good at. It's brought us back to what we had as children.\"\n\nBut it isn't just the younger generations that clutch leftovers from their youth or become interested in child-like activities. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s still collect roomfuls of model train sets, romanticizing the days when the only way to travel was by choo-choo. Women in their 40s acquire American Girl dolls that stir fond memories of reading the novels during childhood.\n\nPsychology experts say it shouldn't be a surprise that the affinity for childhood hobbies and activities extends across generations. After all, Americans have long had an obsession with youth. To be young is associated with being fun, vibrant and active.\n\nIn the Internet age, finding one's inner child has never been easier, with the proliferation of social networks such as Facebook or Web sites like Meetup.com, where users can create groups and meeting times for activities. On the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in Atlanta, Georgia, and action figure discussions in New York City.\n\n\"This is a generation of people who are far less homogenous and more niche-oriented,\" says Judith Sills, a clinical psychologist who works with young adults. \"They can bond around their quirky differences. Ten years ago, you couldn't have easily found another kickball player, even if you wanted to play.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nWAKA Kickball started more than a decade ago by a few friends is now in 33 states\n\n@highlight\n\nThe 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest will attract more than 150 adults this year\n\n@highlight\n\nHundreds of adult soapbox racers will wear costumes to race in Portland, Oregon\n\n@highlight\n\n\"Rejuvenile\" author Noxon says childhood pastimes are becoming more acceptable", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 924, "text": "2004"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How long ago did WAKA Kickball start?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "When did WAKA kickball start?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1409, "text": "more than 150"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many adults are expected to compete in the 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1309, "text": "2009 World Yo-Yo Contest"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What will attract more than 150 adults this year?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1305, "text": "nThe 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest in Orlando, Florida,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what would attract more than 150 adults?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1637, "text": "Portland"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where will the soapbox race be held?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1535, "text": "adults"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who will wear costumes to race in portland?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37c9d33d6eb34c7accdb01fe4357a593766a1f55.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a0de7b33b8f7b24a36c4c4fb9a8e1460dfcd4aae.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- In response to a spate of attacks allegedly by a drug cartel, Mexico more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling the state of Michoacan, a government spokeswoman said.\n\nDrug violence is up in Michoacan state, shown by recent attacks on police in at least a half-dozen cities.\n\nThe government on Thursday dispatched 1,000 federal police officers to Michoacan state in southwest Mexico, increasing its presence to 1,300 total, Public Safety spokeswoman Veronica Penunuri told CNN.\n\nAt least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since the weekend in Michoacan, the home state of President Felipe Calderon.\n\nThe sudden spike in violence followed the arrest Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, whom authorities described as a high-ranking member of the drug cartel known as La Familia Michoacana.\n\nCartel members first attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda, authorities said.\n\nWhen that failed, drug gangs attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities, according to authorities.\n\nThe Michoacan cartel also is accused in the slaying of 12 federal police officers whose bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway.\n\nVideo from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, left by the killers.

The most important center of gravity of the conflict -- as the Taliban well recognizes -- is the American public. And now, most Americans are opposed to the war.\n\nFor years, Afghanistan was \"the forgotten war,\" and when Americans started paying attention again -- roughly around the time of President Obama's inauguration -- what they saw was not a pretty sight: a corrupt Afghan government, a world-class drug trade, a resurgent Taliban and steadily rising U.S. casualties.\n\nMany surely thought: Didn't we win this war eight years ago?\n\nAmericans, of course, hate seeing the deaths of fellow citizens in combat, but even more they hate to see those deaths in the service of a war they believe they are either not winning or maybe even losing, which is one of the reasons why they largely turned against the Iraq war in 2006.\n\nWithin a couple of years, Iraq came back from the brink and started to turn around, after which the war there became largely a nonissue for most Americans. Similarly, the American public would be more likely to tolerate the losses of blood and treasure in Afghanistan if they saw real progress being made there. And right now, they don't.\n\nThe second front we're losing is the Afghans themselves, who are the United States' center of gravity in the Afghan war. Eight years into this conflict, America and its NATO allies -- who are still looked on favorably by a majority of Afghans -- are not providing large swaths of the Afghan population with the most basic public good, which is security.\n\nIt's time to table fancy counterinsurgency doctrines about \"connecting the Afghan people to the government\" -- Afghans have never had, and don't expect much, in the way of services from their government, and it's time now to focus on something much more basic: security.\n\nThe last government to provide Afghans with real security was ... the Taliban. When they ruled the country before 9/11, security came at a tremendous price: a brutal, theocratic regime that bankrupted the country and was a pariah on the world stage.\n\nBut in the context of Afghan history, the Taliban bringing security was decisively important, since what had immediately preceded their iron rule was a nightmarish civil war during which you could be robbed or killed at will by gangs of roving ethnic and tribal militias.\n\nIt is has been a staple of Western political theory since the mid-17th century, when Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan,\" that if the state does not provide security to its people, life will be \"nasty, brutish and short.\" Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan\" in the shadow of the English Civil War, deriving from that bloody conflict the idea that the most important political good the state can deliver is security.\n\nThe United States relearned this lesson in Iraq with some success starting in 2007. But the U.S. seems to have developed instant amnesia about this issue in Afghanistan, where around 40 percent of the country was controlled by the Taliban or was at high risk for attacks by insurgents, according to a private assessment prepared by the Afghan military in April, which was obtained by CNN.\n\nA glaring symbol of the collapse of security in the country is the 300-mile Kabul-to-Kandahar highway, economically and politically the most important road in the country, which is now too dangerous to drive on.\n\nWho will then provide security? The Afghan army is relatively small and generally ineffective. The police are worse. The plans to ramp up the size and efficacy of those forces are, of course, a key part of the American exit strategy from the country. But that training mission is going to take years. Nor are NATO allies going to add significantly more troops. Indeed, a number of NATO countries are already heading to the exits.\n\nThat means that it now falls to the United States to do the heavy lifting in Afghanistan, and if Obama is serious about securing the country and rolling back the Taliban, he really doesn't have much choice but to put significant numbers of more troops on the ground. That way, he can start winning the war: win back the American public, roll back the Taliban -- who have melded ideologically and tactically with al Qaeda -- and provide real security to the Afghan people.\n\nSuch a ramp-up will have an additional benefit. In the larger war on al Qaeda and its allies, the center of gravity is the Pakistani public, military and government because it is in Pakistan where al Qaeda and its Taliban allies are headquartered. And in one of the most important strategic shifts since 9/11, the Pakistani military and government are now getting serious about wiping out large elements of the Taliban and allied groups on their territory and, most importantly, are doing it with the support of their population.\n\nNo longer are Pakistani military operations against militants in Swat and Waziristan seen by Pakistanis as \"America's war\": they are now seen as being in the vital interests of the Pakistani state because the Pakistani Taliban and other jihadist groups have made major strategic errors since early 2009, including marching close to Islamabad, attacking Pakistan's equivalent of the Pentagon and killing hundreds of Pakistani soldiers and policemen.\n\nThis new development is vitally important. Over the years, U.S. military commanders have often talked about hammer and anvil operations in eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan that would bring an American hammer down on the militants based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, who would then in turn be caught on a Pakistani anvil.\n\nIn reality, the American hammer was never large and the Pakistani anvil was never strong.\n\nBut the ongoing Pakistani military incursion into Waziristan, which was preceded by months of \"softening up\" operations with air strikes and artillery as well as a ramped-up American drone program aimed at al Qaeda and Taliban leaders there, is today setting the conditions for a real anvil.\n\nThe hammer must now be applied.\n\nArmed groups don't sue for peace when they believe they might have the upper hand, and right now, the Taliban feel that they are winning the war -- or at least not losing it, which for most insurgencies amounts to the same thing. If there is to be some kind of political reconciliation with elements of the Taliban, that will only come once they truly believe they have no prospect of military success.\n\nAt the same time, key roads, cities and towns in Afghanistan must also be secured. Without providing that security, as Hobbes wrote three and half centuries ago, governments of any kind will fail at their most basic task.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.\n\n@highlight\n\nPeter Bergen: Most Americans now oppose the war in Afghanistan\n\n@highlight\n\nHe says U.S., Afghan government don't provide basic security\n\n@highlight\n\nHobbes said life in nations without security is \"nasty, brutish and short\"\n\n@highlight\n\nBergen: Obama has to add troops if he is serious about repelling Taliban", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2040, "text": "regime"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does Obama have to do, according to Bergen?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 429, "text": "Afghan"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which government don't provide basic security?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who has to add troops?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 6648, "text": "fail"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does Hobbes say about life in nations without security?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3863, "text": "United States"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Does anyone worry about security in Afghanistan?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1862, "text": "The last government to provide Afghans with real"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What security was provided?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 177, "text": "most Americans"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who now oppose the war in Afghanistan?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 192, "text": "are opposed to the"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does Peter Bergen say about most Americans regarding the war in Afghanistan?", "id": "./cnn/stories/8fc35132b9aaa9c0c6745bcc70d6068caa1923d5.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b0abe5b48fa066759e0d8fcf10410c3a13848c54.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film, and the animation studio did not disappoint.\n\nAn adventurous boy and a cranky man travel by unusual means in the new Pixar film \"Up.\"\n\nPixar, which has produced such gems as \"Toy Story,\" \"The Incredibles\" and \"WALL-E,\" introduced its latest feature, \"Up,\" on Wednesday night at the French movie celebration.\n\nBy critics' reckonings, Pixar has never released a bad film, and those who saw \"Up,\" its 10th feature, say the studio's perfect record is still intact.\n\nThe film is a \"captivating odd-couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along,\" wrote Variety's Todd McCarthy. \"The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old, and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that.\"  Gallery: Pixar in pictures »\n\n\"It's a terrific family adventure,\" wrote Peter Bradshaw of Britain's The Guardian. \"The 3-D presentation gives it a real boost, but this film is airborne because of the traditional strengths: story, characterization and inventive animation with the old-fashioned values of clarity and simplicity.\"  See the excitement of Cannes' opening »\n\n\"Up\" concerns Carl Fredericksen, a balloon seller voiced by Ed Asner.

He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support, and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii.\n\nAquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency. She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help.\n\nShe also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos, but Aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States.

Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan\n\nIn the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.\n\nIt was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets.\n\nBut when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.\n\nStruggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role.\n\nIn a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets.\n\nBy revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them.\n\nMental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship\n\n2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough\n\nIn 1966, Danish engineer Karl Krøyer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Krøyer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years.\n\nIndeed, Krøyer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess.\n\nSo in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, \"If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!\"\n\nAlthough it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story.\n\nThe final paragraph read, \"Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago.\"\n\nA footnote revealed that \"literature\" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist.\n\nMental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street\n\nBut why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he'd rediscovered Donald's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures.\n\nGaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg's most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research?\n\n3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail\n\nIn a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he'd fastened to the superhero's wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan.\n\nInspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial.\n\nIn 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration.\n\nToday, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too.\n\nMental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman)\n\n4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day\n\nLike most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers.\n\nDuring his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as \"America's most famous boy hero.\" A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead.\n\nSound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock 'n' roll ways, he copied the 'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century.\n\nBut that wasn't all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King's famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel's lightning bolt insignia.\n\nOf course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland.\n\nPlus, the admiration was mutual. Captain Marvel Jr. paid tribute to The King in one issue, referring to the singer as \"the greatest modern-day philosopher.\"\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

Many see the North Koreans as like us, people we need to care for and help.\"\n\nOutright conflict is not something many would expect, he added.\n\n\"There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting.\n\n\"We're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble. But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack.\n\n\"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time.\"\n\nThe architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation.\n\nWhen Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south.\n\nWhat military hardware does North Korea have?\n\nBut with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification.\n\n\"Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,\" he said.\n\n\"However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s.\n\n\"Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification.\"\n\nBut Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north.\n\n\"Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service,\" he said.\n\n\"Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost.\"\n\nIf reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north.\n\n\"Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today,\" he said.\n\n\"But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn't matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation.\"\n\nAnother view, according to Choi, is \"the Great Successor\" will not last long.\n\n\"He's simply too young,\" he said. Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s.\n\n\"There is this notion in Korean society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you won't last long. No matter how good he is, they think his uncles and more experienced family members will rule from behind him and that he could ultimately be sacrificed.\"\n\nAs pictures of ordinary North Koreans mourning the loss of their Dear Leader continued to filter onto television screens across South Korea Tuesday, Choi felt most people would have been struck by how staged they seemed.\n\n\"The pictures don't reflect the reality in North Korea,\" he argued.\n\n\"When Kim Il Sung died there were a number of people who really went out and cried because they really did respect him.\n\n\"Kim Jong Il's case is different because about two or three million people died of starvation after he came to power. The level of mourning will be about a tenth of what it was in 1994. This is the view of many defectors I have spoken to.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nJournalist: Announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul\n\n@highlight\n\nWoosuk Ken Choi says most people in the south are calm about the situation\n\n@highlight\n\nChoi: \"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time\"\n\n@highlight\n\nSouth Korean military responds to news of Kim's death by raising its alert level", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 241, "text": "nouncement wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who was greeted in Seoul?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1498, "text": "it will be the s"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What happened in 1994?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 594, "text": "g its alert level, while"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the reaction of South Korean military?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1498, "text": "it will be"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who died in 1994?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1488, "text": "g die"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When did Kim II Sung die?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 479, "text": "uk Ken Choi, assi"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who says most people in the south are calm about the situation?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 606, "text": "level,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What level was raised?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 271, "text": "neral as"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the reaction in Seoul?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 295, "text": "oul, ac"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "There was general astonishment where?", "id": "./cnn/stories/280c6cd98b93cfbfcedd1d8961432f5ed819d334.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/7297b0f37e809c5ca79467a535aecb3290a83070.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- As Britain's Prince Harry neared the end of his second and final day in New York City on Saturday, he described his experiences as \"fantastic.\"\n\nPrince Harry smiles whilte touring the Harlem Children's Zone on Saturday during a 36-hour visit to New York.\n\nThe 24-year-old visited the Harlem Children's Zone, a nonprofit organization that offers free programs and classes in a low-income area, then went to Governors Island in New York Harbor to play in the Veuve Clicquot Manhattan Polo Classic.\n\nProfits from the match will benefit Sentebale, a charity for orphans in Lesotho, Africa, a cause Harry's mother, Princess Diana, had promoted.

military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks.\n\nThe United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol.\n\nEthnic tensions in the South Sudan state of Jonglei have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children.\n\nFighters first struck Pibor on Saturday, attacking a portion that was out of the reach of U.N. peacekeepers, said Col. Philip Auger of the South Sudan army.\n\nBenjamin said there were no casualties and no direct confrontation between the two tribes there, because most of the Murle had fled when they heard the Lou Nuer were approaching.\n\nThe nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was still trying Monday to reach 117 of its 130 aid workers who fled into the bush along with the populations of Pibor and Lukangol before the attack, said Sarathy Rajendran, head of the group's South Sudan mission.\n\nRajendran said the organization was afraid for its workers' safety and \"very concerned\" for the people of Pibor and Lukangol.\n\n\"We believe tens of thousands are currently displaced without access to water, food and health care,\" he said. \"The situation is tense.

Three of his previous books involved ex-convict Socrates Fortlow, and another trio concerned bookseller Paris Minton.\n\nBut the new novel takes Mosley to a different place and time. Instead of mid-20th century Los Angeles, \"The Long Fall\" is set in modern-day New York, where McGill is finding it hard to leave his less-than-stellar past behind.\n\nThat past includes a childhood as a red-diaper baby abandoned by his union organizer father and left to fend for himself at an early age, a loveless marriage to an unfaithful woman named Katrina and a son who's a burgeoning criminal mastermind.\n\nMoreover, he's at work on a case where you just know people are going to die.\n\nSuch page turners are nothing new for Mosley, who is known for his strong, black male characters and his passionate musings on race, politics and the writing life.\n\nMcGill's creator recently spoke with CNN about the new mystery novel, why he doesn't miss Easy, and how the changes in the United States are mirrored in his writing. The following is an edited version of the interview.\n\nCNN: Why leave Los Angeles for a setting in modern-day New York?\n\nWalter Mosley: I have been a resident of both cities. The new series being contemporary and about a character who in some murky ways reflects where America is right now, New York seemed the right place for that.\n\nCNN: How so? Where do you think America is right now?\n\nMosley: I think that America has made a decision, after about 20 years of going in one direction, to go in another direction: to leave rampant and amoral kind of deregulation and also rampant and immoral wars and say, \"Maybe we should be doing the right thing instead of the wrong thing,\" or redefining what the right thing is, at any rate.\n\nThose kinds of decisions, there are only two places [the setting] can be, and that's either in Washington, D.C., which I feel is very limiting because it's a one-business town, or New York, where everything from economics to government is centered.\n\nSo I decided on New York.\n\nCNN: McGill is trying to leave behind his shady past. Do you feel like America is trying to do the same?\n\nMosley: Yes, I think that's exactly what's happening. I think America is trying to seek redemption after having done many things wrong in the eyes of the world in general.\n\nLeonid McGill is trying to seek redemption after a long criminal history. His history is somewhat forgivable, but still it's criminal.\n\nCNN: Did you approach this book differently than you did when you were writing the Easy Rawlins mysteries?\n\nMosley: Yes and no. All books are different, so each of the Easy Rawlins books I wrote I approached differently. [Leonid] is a new character and he has a unique life that I had to begin to learn. I knew Easy very well, but Leonid I had to learn who he was.\n\nCNN: In your new book, I love that McGill's wife's name is \"Katrina\" and she leaves lots of destruction in her wake.\n\nMosley: [chuckling] It's true, but the first story I wrote about Leonid [a story called \"Karma\" published in the anthology \"Dangerous Women\"] was before the hurricane and that was a long time ago. It's funny that it worked out like that.\n\nCNN: What do you like about McGill?\n\nMosley: This is the first time in my experiments in crime fiction that I've written a hard-boiled detective character. This is going all the way back to the beginning of the genre in the '30s, where you have a guy who gets thumped upside the head a lot and he's just as bad as the people he's after.\n\nIn the old style, you never knew what was going on inside the hard-boiled character's head, but in these stories I am actually discovering the underlying character of the hard-boiled detective, and for me that's been a great deal of fun.\n\nCNN: You've written so many various genres. What is it about the genre of crime fiction that appeals to you?\n\nMosley: Originally I got into it because you can talk about worlds that people wouldn't read about ordinarily unless they had a particular interest in it. Everybody reads crime fiction and they read it to find out about different worlds.\n\nI like writing in different genres. There's all this stuff that I really enjoy doing because I think they all serve different purposes.\n\nAnd listen, I'm known as a crime writer, people like it and I enjoy it.\n\nCNN: For your fans, a lot of them miss Easy Rawlins. Do you miss him at all?\n\nMosley: No, he's right there on the shelf. All I have to do is reach up and pull him down.\n\nI'm finished with that.

They also discussed whether Boyle will develop the emotional stamina for a high-pressure singing career.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: What do we know right now?\n\nAmanda Holden: Basically, we've spoken to Susan's brother. He, in fact, spoke on [CBS' \"The Early Show\"] this morning to say that his sister was very keen to come home as soon as she possibly could and that she was resting up in a clinic in London and that she was very much looking forward to coming out and seeing what was available to her when she felt better.\n\nKing: Is the show, Amanda, paying for the hospital bills and are they taking care of her?\n\nHolden: I have no idea if they're paying the hospital bills. I would imagine that they are. We're a very loyal show. We love Susan very much. In fact, all the contestants that appear on our show are extraordinarily well looked after.\n\nKing: Your fellow judge, Piers Morgan, has said that there was talk of taking her off the show because of all the pressures on her. Were you involved? Were there any discussions like that?\n\nHolden: I wasn't involved in any discussions like that. And I think Piers has a slightly closer relationship with her.  ... The only thing I'm worried about with Susan Boyle is that she seems to have a crush on Piers Morgan. ...\n\nI think that Piers kind of reassured her during the final that she was doing well and that she mustn't pay any kind of attention to the press and all the other stuff that was going\n\nKing: Despite all the tumult, there's no disputing that Susan sang her heart out during the finale of the competition. I know the dance troupe [Diversity] was terrific. But, frankly, why didn't she win?\n\nHolden: Honestly, I can't criticize the decision because it was the British public that voted in the end. I have no real idea, to be honest. I wonder whether it could be that Diversity was utterly fantastic on the show that night. They decimated the show. They really, really were amazing. And I just wonder whether maybe younger people voted and were quicker on the texts than the kind of people that were voting for Susan.\n\nBut as I keep saying, if Susan is a loser, then surely she is the biggest and best loser that we have in the world. And coming second is no bad thing.  Watch Amanda Holden discuss Susan Boyle »\n\nKing: She came in, though, [as] a small-town amateur singer, [with] learning disabilities due to suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. Some say the program exploited her and her vulnerabilities. Do you agree?\n\nHolden: I couldn't disagree more. You know, she's a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show. She enjoyed every second of every moment that I met her or saw her behind the scenes. She was very excited. She was very proud to be taking part in the show.\n\nI think the downturn in press in our country [Britain], I think, maybe stressed her out a little bit. And I think she was just quite upset about all the exaggerated stories and the kind of falsehoods that were being written about her. I think that everybody gets upset about bad press when you're in this business. And she's somebody that's gone from anonymity to [an] absolute worldwide phenomenon.\n\nKing: Yes.\n\nHolden: So how is she expected to handle that? Nobody can handle that with the best will in the world. I've been in the business 15 years, and I'm still not media savvy.\n\n[Dr. Drew Pinsky joins the show]\n\nKing: What do you make of this Susan Boyle thing?\n\nPinsky: The problem here is that here's a woman that's suddenly under the scrutiny of the spotlight who maybe has some  developmental issues, who is under tremendous stress and [now] is in a psychiatric hospital. The question is, did the show harm her?\n\nKing: Did it?\n\nPinsky: It's hard to say. This is the first time these kind of experiences have really been undertaken by people. People that come out of nowhere all of a sudden are international superstars.\n\nKing: Should we be, Amanda, concerned about that?\n\nHolden: First of all, I just want to say that Susan's brother said on British television this morning that, yes, Susan has experienced learning difficulties. But in actual fact, when she was at school, she did as well as any of her other siblings. But throughout her childhood, always before an exam or anything else, she always got quite anxious.\n\n[Before the show], she was feeling nervous. But she went out there and she nailed it. You know, she did the best performance that we've seen. And let's not forget, this is actually only the second or third time we've heard her sing. ...\n\nShe is in a place where celebrities go when they are burnt out. Now, I am obviously not a doctor. I have no factual information to give to you. I can only say to you her brother ... has said she wants to come home within a matter of days, rather than weeks.\n\nPinsky: That's excellent.\n\nKing: Would you guess, Dr. Drew, that she still has a career in front of her? Wouldn't you bet she does?\n\nPinsky: Oh, I bet she does, absolutely. And she will learn to become accustomed to this kind of stress, I am sure. But let's make sure she has the care she needs.\n\nAnd let's be sure that ... everybody that goes on shows like this has access to things that help them deal with the stress of these kinds of environments.\n\n@highlight\n\nAmanda Holden: Boyle is \"a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show\"\n\n@highlight\n\nHolden believes negative press coverage stressed out the overnight sensation\n\n@highlight\n\nThough Boyle was exceedingly nervous before finale, Holden says she \"nailed it\"\n\n@highlight\n\nDr. Drew Pinsky: Contestants on high-pressure shows should get help with stress", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1494, "text": "have no idea if they're paying the hospital bills.

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas.\n\nA new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas, which holds primaries March 4.\n\nIn the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama.\n\nBut taking into account the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie.  Watch Democrats target Texas. »\n\nTwo recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even. Map: National and state polling\n\n\"One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options,\" says CNN polling director Keating Holland.\n\n\"Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues.\n\n\"Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama.\"\n\nMany political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton. Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Texas.\n\nThe new survey indicates Arizona Sen. John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAmong Republicans, 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee. Thirty-two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul. The poll's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points.\n\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday. Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas, including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters.\n\nMcCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity.\n\nThe poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston.  Watch McCain get a big boost »\n\nBut McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters. Just last week, McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary, according to exit polls. The new survey, though, suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas.\n\n\"It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans,\" Holland said.\n\n\"McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary. The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks.\"\n\nTexas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what's the most important issue. Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president.\n\nThe second most important issue for Democrats was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent.\n\nNineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent.\n\nSixty percent of Republicans say they'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing. That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats.\n\nLikely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms. Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Obama. Seventy-nine percent say it's likely Clinton can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Obama.\n\nThe two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Iraq and the economy, but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion.

Clarence Holeman said.\n\nHoleman identified the dead as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\n\nFriends identified Bruce as the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, the theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater.\n\nTwo other people were wounded by ricocheting bullets, Holeman said, but did not identify them. At least 20 people were in attendance at the event, he said.\n\nZinkhan was not at the theater event initially, Holeman said, but when he arrived, he got into \"a disagreement\" with his wife. He left the scene -- police believe to his car, where his children were waiting -- and returned with two handguns.\n\n\"It only took a few minutes,\" Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings, he said.\n\nAfter the shootings, Zinkhan left the scene with his two children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children there.\n\nThe neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children.\n\n\"He rang the doorbell -- asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,\" Covington said. \"I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off.\"\n\nZinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn't question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children.\n\nAn hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children.\n\nCovington described Zinkhan as \"a very quiet guy, but family-oriented.\"\n\n\"He was great around his kids,\" he said. \"Never saw a bit of a problem between he his wife or his kids.\"\n\nCovington said he was \"completely shocked, didn't believe it\" when he heard the news, and said he knew Marie Bruce much better than her husband.\n\n\"She was much more talkative, very vivacious,\" he said.\n\nPolice Maj. Mike Shockley told CNN that officers were searching Zinkhan's home Saturday and that a wide search for the suspect was in progress.\n\n\"It's still a hunt,\" he said. \" ... Now it's just a matter of trying to locate him.\"\n\nHoleman said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He was last seen driving a red, 2005 Jeep Liberty, Holeman said.\n\nThe news reverberated across Athens.\n\n\"The University community is shocked and saddened at this tragic event,\" University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams, said in a written statement. \"Our first thoughts are for safety of the university community and for prompt apprehension of the person responsible. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who have been affected.\"\n\nAnother university professor, Steve Elliott-Gower, told CNN that Zinkhan had been at the school for at least 10 years and was \"a distinguished professor with a national reputation.\"\n\n\"He was quirky and aloof, but absolutely nothing that I saw would lead me to this conclusion,\" said the professor.

Check back for updates on his trip.\n\nCNN.com's Jarrett Bellini tours vineyards outside Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- I'm not a wine drinker.\n\nBefore today's excursion, in fact, I could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine: red, white and Carlo Rossi.  The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice.\n\nSo, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum.\n\nOur guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm?\n\nThroughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy.\n\nNow, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something.\n\nEven without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11.\n\nI personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway.\n\nWhat can I say?

He was babbling under the hooves of a boss mare.\n\nRupert Isaacson says he noticed immediate improvement in his son's language skills when he started riding.\n\n\"I thought he was going to get trampled,\" recalled Rupert Isaacson, Rowan's father.\n\nBut the horse, Betsy, dipped her head and chewed with her mouth in submission. Isaacson, who had trained horses for a living, had never seen it happen so spontaneously. Rowan had seemingly made a connection.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, family had been struggling with Rowan.\n\nHis wild tantrums were nearly driving Isaacson and his wife, Kristin Neff, to divorce. All the while, little Rowan was becoming unreachable.\n\n\"He would just stare off into space,\" Isaacson said. \"I was worried it was going to get progressively worse and that eventually, he might float away from us entirely. Luckily, right about that time is when he met Betsy.\"\n\nIsaacson began riding Betsy, a neighbor's horse, with Rowan. He says he noticed immediate improvement in his son's language skills.  Watch Rowan and Betsy »\n\n\"He would start to answer. He would start to talk. We would do song games up there on the saddle. I would take books up there in the saddle,\" Isaacson said.\n\nAutism specialists say that horse riding can be effective in gaining access to autistic children.\n\nExperts make a distinction between the kind of recreational therapeutic riding Isaacson was using with Rowan and hippotherapy, which is a medical treatment that uses horses and is supervised by a licensed speech-language pathologist.\n\n\"People perceive it's the interaction with the horse that's making the change. However, the movement of the horse is extremely powerful, and it's that movement that's having neurological impact on the autistic child,\" said Ruth Dismuke-Blakely, a speech-language pathologist and hippotherapy clinical specialist in Edgewood, New Mexico.\n\nAccording to preliminary analysis of an ongoing study by Dismuke-Blakely, hippotherapy has been shown to increase verbal communication skills in some autistic children in as little as 18 to 25 minutes of riding once a week for eight weeks.\n\n\"We see their arousal and affect change. They become more responsive to cues. If they are at a point where they are using verbal cues, you get more words,\" Dismuke-Blakely said. \"It's almost like it opens them up. It gives us access.\"\n\nShe cautions that a horse's movements can be powerful. For some autistic children, riding too long can overstimulate their nervous system, leading to more erratic behavior.\n\nOn Betsy, Rowan was at ease. After about three weeks, Isaacson says, Rowan's improved behavior was translating into the home and outside world as well.\n\nBut not consistently.\n\nIn late 2004, Isaacson, a human rights activist, brought a delegation of African bushmen from Botswana to the United Nations. Among the men were traditional healers, who offered to work with Rowan.\n\nIsaacson says he was skeptical, but he had experience with the bushmen and allowed the healers to lay their hands on his son.\n\n\"I was kind of flabbergasted at Rowan's response. For about four days while they were with him, he started to lose some of his symptoms. He started to point, which was a milestone he hadn't achieved,\" Isaacson said.\n\nWhen the tribal healers left, Rowan regressed.\n\nIsaacson says he couldn't help but wonder what would happen if he were to give Rowan a longer exposure to the two things that he seemed to have responded well to: horses and shamans.\n\n\"I know it sounds completely crazy,\" he said. \"I just had a gut feeling.\"\n\nIsaacson took his wife and son to Mongolia.\n\n\"It's the oldest horse culture on the planet. Everyone still gets around on a horse there -- so a nomadic culture. The word 'shaman' comes from there,\" Isaacson said, explaining his decision. \"I just thought, 'Well, what if we went there and rode across the steppe and visited traditional healers? You know, what might happen for Rowan? Might there be some positive outcomes?' \"\n\nTrekking across the Mongolian prairie on horseback, Isaacson says, Rowan's behavior was changed dramatically.\n\n\"Rowan was not cured of autism out there,\" Isaacson stressed. \"The word 'cure' is not in my vocabulary for this. Rowan came back without three key dysfunctions that he had. He went out to Mongolia incontinent and still suffering from these neurological firestorms -- so tantruming all the time and cut off from his peers, unable to make friends -- and he came back with those three dysfunctions having gone.\"\n\nIsaacson credits Rowan's improvement to horses and time in nature -- and to shamanic healing, which he says he simply can't explain rationally.\n\nIsaacson has written a book, \"The Horse Boy,\" about Rowan's autism.\n\nRowan, now 7, rides Betsy by himself. His parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for his autism, and Rowan's applied behavioral analysis therapist has him studying math and English at the third-grade level -- a full year ahead of some of his peers.\n\n\"He's just becoming a very functional autistic person,\" Isaacson said.\n\nAs far as the Isaacson family's journey took them, it is the same hard slog facing millions of families gripped by autism.\n\n\"A lot of the parents go to the ends of the Earth in their own living rooms every day,\" Isaacson said. \"I mean, we had more stressful car rides to the grocery store than any of the stresses and challenges of the trip to Mongolia.\"\n\nYou don't have to get on a horse -- or plane to Siberia -- for relief. For autism families, Isaacson encourages parents to simply follow their instincts and listen to what their child shows them.\n\n\"In our case, it was horses in Mongolia and these shamans,\" Isaacson said. \"It could just as easily have been bicycles and, you know, steam trains. And if it had been, we'd have done a steam train journey. We'd have done whatever Rowan seemed to be showing us he wanted to do, because that was where he was intrinsically motivated.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nFamily travels across Mongolia so autistic son can ride horses, meet shaman\n\n@highlight\n\nExperts say riding horses can be effective in gaining access to autistic children\n\n@highlight\n\nRowan Isaacson's language and temper improved with horse/shaman therapy\n\n@highlight\n\nHis parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for Rowan's autism", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 156, "text": "autistic"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What disorder does Rowan Isaacson have?", "id": "./cnn/stories/de283c0874510efe9c5750c91649cd620d150cb4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3836, "text": "the plane"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did the family travel?", "id": "./cnn/stories/de283c0874510efe9c5750c91649cd620d150cb4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1438, "text": "n gaining access to autistic children.\\n\\nExperts make a"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What do experts say about riding horses?", "id": "./cnn/stories/de283c0874510efe9c5750c91649cd620d150cb4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2830, "text": "the home"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What improved when Rowan Isaacson did horse and shaman therapy?", "id": "./cnn/stories/de283c0874510efe9c5750c91649cd620d150cb4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3836, "text": "the plane"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What country did the family travel across?", "id": "./cnn/stories/de283c0874510efe9c5750c91649cd620d150cb4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1115, "text": "wan.

He spoke to CNN's Larry King about the decision and President Obama's health care plans. Here is an edited transcript:\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta says he just returned from India, where he looked into medical tourism.\n\nLarry King: But, first, breaking news about CNN's own Dr. Sanjay Gupta, long rumored to be the main candidate for U.S. surgeon general. He's taken himself out of the running. Joins us now here in Los Angeles to talk about it. Why?\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta: Well, first of all, it was a really tough decision, and a long decision and a long process for sure. And I was incredibly flattered, humbled by the consideration even for the position.\n\nI think for me it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else. You know, I have two daughters. Our third daughter is now imminent. In fact, I have my phone on right here, I might get called off the set.\n\nKing: As we talk.\n\nGupta: As we talk, my wife is imminent with our third child. You know, this job that we have collectively takes us away from our children for so many years at once, and I sort of came to grips with the fact that I'd probably be away at least the first several years, four or five years -- there's my existing two daughters, one more on the way -- but several years of their lives. And I just didn't feel like I should do that now.\n\nAnd the other thing, let me just add, you know, you know me and a lot of people know me, obviously, as a journalist for CNN, but you know, I continue to practice neurosurgery, Larry. You and I have talked about that, and I...\n\nKing: You do brain surgery all the time.\n\nGupta: Yes. And it's an important part of my life. And I work at a county hospital. That's the hospital I've chosen to work at in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I really enjoy that.\n\nI came to grips with, ironically, that being surgeon general, I probably would not be able to continue to practice surgery.\n\nKing: How about the cut in pay?\n\nGupta: Well, you know, that's a sacrifice we were willing to make.\n\nI think, you know, either you're a public servant or you're not a public servant. I've always been drawn to public service. So that really wasn't a consideration for me.\n\nKing: Was it an offer or a \"would you consider if\"?\n\nGupta: It's a little bit of a funny thing -- and I've never been through this process before. I guess the formal part of it is when you are nominated. I was not nominated, but I had conversations with the senior-most people that would make an offer, and they told me they wanted me to do this job. So...\n\nKing: Was it the thought of [Democratic former] Sen. Tom Daschle, who was going to be secretary of health, that you be his surgeon general?\n\nGupta: Well, I did have conversations with him, but you know, the fact that he withdrew did not play as big a role in my mind in terms of not considering the job. Again, I think either you do public service or you don't. You want your job to be as precisely defined as possible, for sure, but that wasn't a major factor.\n\nKing: The way it was presented, then, you feel that you would have been offered it even if Daschle had not left or had left, no matter what?\n\nGupta: I think so. You know, I mean, you know, I've had a lot of conversations with the White House folks. I think there was a big interest on their part, and obviously they know of my dedication to public service. I think there was a real melding there.\n\nKing: Do you have anyone you would recommend for that job?\n\nGupta: You know, no one off the top of my head. I mean, I think whoever takes that job really does have to make it a higher-profile job. I mean, this is an important job. I have a great deal of respect for the office and for the commissioned corps. You've seen the work they do. They do life-saving...\n\nKing: A lot of clout.\n\nGupta: Yes, a lot of clout, life-saving, life-preventing work -- or life-preserving work -- all over the country every single day. And I think that it has to have a little bit of a higher profile. Whoever takes this job has to be out there really advocating the issues of public health. At no time is it probably more important than right now, as we're dealing with health care reform. These issues really go hand in hand.\n\nKing: Well, their loss is a continuing our gain.\n\nGupta: I appreciate that.\n\nKing: If I may speak to it.\n\nGupta: I would miss this witty banter for sure, back and forth.\n\nKing: May I speak for CNN. But you had to be flattered.\n\nGupta: I was flattered. And you know, I have a great deal of respect for that office. And I in no way want people to think that I don't. This is really more about my family and my surgical career.\n\nKing: Couple other notes. I know you're just back from India. I want to ask about that.\n\nGupta: Yes.\n\nKing: President Obama held a health care summit [Thursday] at the White House. More than 100 experts, policy makers took part, including some who opposed the Clinton administration's health care reform back in the '90s. Do you support his aims?\n\nGupta: He is drawing an inextricable relationship between the economy and health care. As people talk -- the economy is issue No. 1, as we talk about all the time. But he's making the point, I think, and he has been for some time, even while he was campaigning, that you cannot talk about the economy without talking about health care.\n\nThe businesses have to provide health care insurance for their employees. It is often very difficult for them to do that, in addition to trying to reach some sort of profit from their product. So I -- that message, I think, has been pretty loud and clear, and I think it is resonating.\n\nHe's also talking about the fact that you can't fix the health care system without bringing down costs of health care overall. And since you brought it up, I was just in India, and one of the stories that I was doing was about medical tourism. Here is a good example -- 750,000 Americans leave the United States every year to go abroad for life-saving operations. Why? Mainly because of cost. It can be up to a tenth of the cost in some of these countries such as India, such as Singapore.\n\nKing: Open-heart surgery in India might be one-tenth of what it costs here?\n\nGupta: One-tenth. Hip surgery, neurosurgery. All -- a lot of these various operations. And the real question, and I think it's a question worth exploring, is why? How can they do it so much cheaper?\n\nHow can they offer good-quality care? I saw it. It is good-quality care. I saw that with my own eyes. What do we have to learn? And how can we use this to help reform our health care system?\n\nKing: Is there an assumption that we have the best doctors, that we do it better than anybody else, that's an American assumption?\n\nGupta: Yes. And I think, you know, we do provide very good health care for people who have access to it.\n\nKing: Ah.\n\nGupta: And I think that's part of the problem.\n\nKing: That's the rub, though, right?\n\nGupta: That is the rub. And I think there are really two schools of thought, which we are going to hopefully distill down, as we talk about this issue more and more. One is, do you revamp the entire health care system? Do you say, look, this health care system is broken, toss it all out, let's start all over again? Or do you say, look, it works pretty well for a fraction of the population. Let's see who it doesn't work for and fix those things only. So don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Let's target what's broken and focus on that.\n\nKing: What role in all of this will the new surgeon general play?\n\nGupta: I really don't know. I'm not sure. At one point...\n\nKing: He would have to be a proponent for it, you would think.\n\nGupta: You know, the surgeon general has an interesting position, and this is something that I learned. It is truly one of the more apolitical positions at that senior level. So they are really the nation's doctor. I think that they really have to focus on making sure that best health practices are constantly known. It's amazing how high the health illiteracy rate remains in this country. To remind people how to best take care of themselves.\n\nKing: One other thing. Do you think it's going to -- do you think we're going to get a new health care program?\n\nGupta: I think so. It's going to take a long time. I think that it may not even happen within this first term, if there is a second term for him. So I think it's not going to be something that happens certainly overnight. The fact that they had a health care summit this early on I think is probably a good sign of at least his commitment to this issue.\n\n@highlight\n\nGupta: \"It really came down to a sense of timing\"\n\n@highlight\n\nGupta says job would have taken him away too long from family\n\n@highlight\n\nGupta talks about challenges Obama faces in reforming health care", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 879, "text": "timing"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What challenges are discussed?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1204, "text": "children"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What would the job have taken him from?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1181, "text": "takes us away from our children"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the disadvantage of the job?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 870, "text": "sense of timing"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did it come down to?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 504, "text": "U.S. surgeon general."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What would have taken him away too long from family?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 8458, "text": "Gupta:"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who faces challenges in reforming health care?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What challenges does Obama face?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6a0f9c8a5d0c6e8949b37924163c92923fe5770d.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/3593798438099ec3f8aac417a79a0b2e8b07a490.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(Travel + Leisure) -- Warm beige tones, rich graphic accents, and futuristic chairs give Le Jules Verne a contemporary elegance, while dishes from superstar chef Alain Ducasse create a joie de vivre in diners' mouths.

It turns out he was also a spy for the Union Army, providing key secrets to the North about the Confederacy.\n\nWilliam Jackson, a slave, listened closely to Jefferson Davis' conversations and leaked them to the North.\n\nJackson was Davis' house servant and personal coachman. He learned high-level details about Confederate battle plans and movements because Davis saw him as a \"piece of furniture\" -- not a human, according to Ken Dagler, author of \"Black Dispatches,\" which explores espionage by America's slaves.\n\n\"Because of his role as a menial servant, he simply was ignored,\" Dagler said.  \"So Jefferson Davis would hold conversations with military and Confederate civilian officials in his presence.\"\n\nDagler has written extensively on the issue for the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence .  Watch the stories of slaves as spies »\n\nIn late 1861, Jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by Union soldiers. Dagler said Jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy.\n\n\"In Jackson's case, what he did was ... present some of the current issues that were affecting the Confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines. He actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems,\" Dagler said.\n\nJackson and other slaves' heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war -- lost amid the nation's racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war's historic battles. But historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of  African-Americans during those war years.\n\nJackson's espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell refers to \"Jeff Davis' coachman\" as the source of information about Confederate deployments.  Watch grandson of slaves: \"They call me Little Man\" »\n\nDagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information, in large part because of their tradition of oral history. Because Southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write, he said, the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them.\n\n\"What the Union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line ... was that if you talked to them, they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person ... because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records,\" he said.\n\nJackson wasn't the only spy. There were hundreds of them. In some cases, the slaves made it to the North, only to return to the South to risk being hanged. One Union general wrote that he counted on black spies in Tennessee because \"no white man had the pluck to do it.\"\n\nNo one was better than Robert Smalls, a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina.

In 1863, she was asked by the Union to help with espionage in South Carolina. She picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself.\n\n\"The height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into South Carolina,\" Dagler said. \"In addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property, she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the North.\"\n\nAs the nation marks Black History Month in February, Dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the African-Americans who risked their lives for their nation. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\"They were all over the place, and no one [in the South] considered them to be of any value.

Kennedy's funeral. After the service, on the steps outside, the slain president's young son famously saluted his father's memory.\n\nBut the church is also the site of an annual Mass that has drawn criticism for what many see as an unhealthy mix of politics, the law and religion.\n\nWashington's annual Red Mass, which celebrates the legal profession, will be held this year on Sunday, October 4 -- the day before the Supreme Court begins its new term. Several justices traditionally attend, along with congressional leaders, diplomats, cabinet secretaries and other dignitaries.\n\nPast presidents have also attended, though there is no word yet on whether President Obama will appear.\n\nIt is a Catholic service, but power brokers of other faiths are asked to attend the invitation-only event. Justice Stephen Breyer, who is Jewish, is a regular.\n\nThe Mass \"takes its name from the color of the vestments. ... [It] goes back centuries, to Rome, to France to England,\" Washington Archbishop Donald Wuerl said.\n\n\"There was the idea [to] bring all the people who are involved in the law ... once a year so that together, they can simply pray for the wisdom of God.\"\n\nThe church, built starting in the 19th century, is considered one of Washington's hidden gems. Tucked between modern office buildings a few blocks from the White House, it is a mix of architectural styles, a hint of ancient Roman style, a splash from the Italian Renaissance and a definite Byzantine flavor.\n\nSt. Matthew, noted Monsignor Ronald Jameson, was the patron saint of civil servants, appropriate in a city where the federal government dominates the workforce.\n\nFive justices attended last year's Red Mass, which was similar in tone to other recent gatherings. Cardinal John Patrick Foley, who has held several prominent positions in the Catholic Church, noted many parts of the Bible \"sound very much like American ideals\" and reminded the members of the high court to build a society \"of justice, of peace and of love.\"\n\nCritics of the service, however, find the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, to be inappropriate.\n\n\"The truth is, this was set up as a way to basically lecture and give information to the justices,\" said the Rev. Barry Lynn, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. \"There is no other institution that has this special way to talk to the justices on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Red Mass was started in Washington in 1952 by the John Carroll Society, a lay Catholic group of prominent lawyers and professionals. Chief Justice John Roberts' wife, Jane, is an officer of the group.\n\nLynn, an ordained minister with the United Church of Christ, noted the Mass was begun after several high court decisions that were disapproved of by the archdiocese.\n\n\"They figured if they got all the justices together and chatted them up in a worship service, they might be able to convince them to see the law their way,\" he said.\n\nIn 1989, a top church official used the occasion of the Mass to call for a return to \"religiously based moral values\" and lament the \"inviolable, impenetrable and towering wall\" between church and state.\n\nIn 1986, Washington Cardinal James Hickey attacked the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion.\n\nAmong those in attendance that year were then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and William Brennan, both Catholics.\n\nOne member of the court who no longer attends is Ruth Bader Ginsburg who, like Breyer, is Jewish. Ginsberg said she grew tired of being lectured to by Catholic officials.\n\n\"I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion,\" Ginsburg said in the book \"Stars of David: Prominent Jews talk About Being Jewish\" by author Abigail Pogrebin.\n\n\"Even the Scalias, although they're much of that persuasion, were embarrassed for me.\"\n\nSix Catholics now sit on the high court: Roberts, Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nChurch officials, however, said they do not attempt to lobby or seek to persuade anyone who attends the service. Wuerl likens the experience to putting aside the partisanship and troubles in the world and seeking comfort in a shared community and a sacred place.\n\nAmericans have \"been very careful about ... not allowing any one tradition or church to become the state church,\" he said. \"But from the very beginning, we've always said we need to hear the voice of faith in all the discussion that is a part of determining what we want to do.\"\n\nLynn takes a different tack.\n\n\"I don't think there is any doubt that people in that congregation, including the Supreme Court justices, are going to listen to what is said. They might hear something phrased in a way you might never hear it in the court, but it might become a lingering factor in their decisions. ... People who are concerned about the Red Mass worry about this kind of undue influence, an influence that no other group, religious or otherwise, has on those nine men and women.\"\n\nTheir sharply differing perspectives show that, more than two centuries after the Constitution's ratification, the interpretation of the First Amendment and the role of religion in American society remain hotly contested questions.\n\nCNN's Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nAnnual Catholic Mass in Washington celebrates the legal profession\n\n@highlight\n\nIt began in 1952; several Supreme Court justices regularly attend\n\n@highlight\n\nIt is touted as a chance for those involved in law to pray for wisdom\n\n@highlight\n\nCritic says Mass set up to \"lecture and give information to the justices\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 598, "text": "Red Mass,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what several Supreme Court justices regularly attend?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What do critics say the Mass is set up to do?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 598, "text": "Red"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what Annual Catholic Mass in Washington celebrates?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 673, "text": "Sunday, October 4"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When did it begin?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2344, "text": "the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, to be inappropriate.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What do critics say", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2790, "text": "Washington in 1952"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When did the mass begin", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 629, "text": "legal profession,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does the Annual Catholic Mass in Washington celebrate?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 629, "text": "legal profession,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does the annual catholic mass celebrate", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 578, "text": "Washington's annual Red Mass,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what It is touted as a chance for those involved in law?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6570180535f4a5a28e6f5d43f46c8f635a509cda.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/36171b3054885df4cf9ed97c5e7879bc3ed48a76.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Vero Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Louis Schacht's family has been growing citrus in Vero Beach, Florida, for 60 years, contributing to a multibillion-dollar industry.

Calvin Gibbs has been sentenced to life in military prison with eligibility for parole in 10 years.\n\nA military court-martial Thursday found Gibbs guilty of murdering three Afghan civilians, illegally cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as \"souvenirs\" and planting weapons to make the men appear as if they were Taliban fighters killed in legitimate firefights.\n\nHe was reduced in rank to private and ordered to forfeit all pay and benefits. Whatever sentence Gibbs serves will be reduced by the 547 days he has already spent in prison.\n\n\"He said they were all dirty savages,\" prosecutor Maj. Andre Leblanc said at Gibbs' sentencing hearing.\n\n\"He is the savage, not the innocent Afghans he murdered. It is monstrous. What kind of savagery does it take to do this? To cut a finger off a victim and show it to people? This is a savage being\"\n\nGibbs' attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, had asked the court for a sentence of life with parole so Gibbs would have the opportunity to be with his now-3-year-old son again.\n\n\"He has a long time to reflect on his life, what he has done and what he wants to do in the future,\" Stackhouse said.\n\nGibbs is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue \"kill squad\" that targeted civilians. Another seven soldiers also were charged with lesser crimes including abusing drugs, keeping \"off the books\" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier not to speak out against the platoon's alleged killings.\n\nGibbs had pleaded not guilty.\n\nA prosecutor described Gibbs as a \"recruiting poster\" soldier. But the tall, clean-cut Gibbs and the \"kill squad\" he was convicted of leading turned into a public-relations nightmare for the military.\n\n\"Sgt. Gibbs had a charisma, he had a 'follow me' personality,\" Maj. Robert Stelle, a prosecutor in the case, told the court in closing arguments Wednesday. \"But it was all a bunch of crap, he had his own mission: murder and depravity.\"\n\nThe murders Gibbs is accused of committing took place over a period of five months last year, while Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the ArmyÂ¹s 5th Stryker Brigade in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.\n\nGibbs' platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with an Afghan population wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead, prosecutors said Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers allegedly plotted to murder civilians and then planted weapons on them so they appeared to be Taliban attackers.\n\n\"Selling a fake engagement as a real engagement, that's what they were doing,\" Stelle told the court.\n\nIn court testimony, Gibbs said he did not execute anyone. Prosecutors said Gibbs participated in the killings of three unarmed civilians: two farmers and a village cleric.\n\nGibbs said he killed one of the men, but he claimed it was in self-defense. However, the staff sergeant admitted to ripping and cutting off fingers of all three men he was charged with killing. He kept the body parts, he said, to give to soldiers he favored or to intimidate soldiers he disliked.\n\n\"I was numb to the situation,\" Gibbs told the court about why he had taken the body parts. \"I wasn't thinking; it's sickening. I am embarrassed.\"\n\nGibbs also admitted to posing for photos with bodies against military regulations.\n\n\"People wanted to prove they were there,\" Gibbs replied when asked by his attorney why the soldiers took the photos. The Army later apologized after the photos were leaked to the press.\n\nGibbs appeared shocked after the verdict was read, and his wife, Army Spec. Chelsy Gibbs, began to cry. According to court records, she filed for divorce from Staff Sgt. Gibbs in August and asked for custody of their toddler son.\n\nThe panel of three officers and two enlisted soldiers started deliberating in a military courtroom near Tacoma shortly before 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) and returned its verdict around 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET).\n\nPhillip Stackhouse, Gibbs' defense attorney, had argued other soldiers were framing his client. Three soldiers pleaded guilty to the killings and agreed to testify against Gibbs as part of plea deals.\n\n\"What if there is no hard evidence other than what you have heard from that witness stand?\" Stackhouse said Wednesday. Some witnesses also admitted to smoking hashish they obtained from Afghan translators. Their testimony, Stackhouse said, \"came under a cloud of hash.\"\n\nStackhouse argued Gibbs wasn't where other witnesses said he was during the engagements. And, according to Stackhouse, in February 2010 Gibbs couldn't have smuggled an AK-47 in his backpack into a village where prosecutors said he then planted the assault rifle on the body of an Afghan man he had killed. Grasping an AK-47, Stackhouse showed the rifle would not fully fit into a soldier's backpack.\n\nProsecutors countered that Gibbs had used a model of the rifle that has a shorter muzzle and could be concealed.\n\nGibbs remains under investigation for the 2004 shooting death of a family in Iraq during his tour there, Army spokesman Maj. Chris Ophardt told CNN Thursday. The investigation into the family's killing had been closed but was reopened after Gibbs was charged with the murders of civilians in Afghanistan.\n\nDuring testimony last week, Gibbs said he shot at a car that failed to stop at a checkpoint in Iraq that he was manning.\n\nInside the bullet-riddled car, Gibbs testified, were not combatants but an unarmed Iraqi family. Gibbs admitted in court that he told his troops in Afghanistan about the Iraq shooting as an example that soldiers would not face consequences for acting aggressively, even if civilians were hurt.\n\n\"If they are put in a tight situation, don't not pull the trigger,\" Gibbs said he advised members of his platoon in Afghanistan. \"You won't go to jail for it.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nStaff Sgt.

He spoke to CNN.com about being an openly gay actor.\n\n\"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,\" says actor Bryan Batt, who is openly gay.\n\n(CNN) -- There was once a time when the revelation of one's homosexuality in Hollywood was thought to be a career-killer.\n\nNow, out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine. There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\n\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\n\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\n\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\n\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\n\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles »\n\nCNN: When did you come out?\n\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\n\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\n\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\n\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\n\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\n\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\n\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\n\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\n\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\n\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men\"?\n\nBatt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever. What a great role to play. This season, I'm married. I get stopped all the time on the street, and I get asked, \"When is your character coming out?\" What is he coming out to in 1962?\n\nI asked to get married this season. I thanked [series creator] Matthew Weiner, and he said, \"You asked.\" It provides another wonderful level to the character. That is what happened then and unfortunately still happens today.\n\n[In a recent episode, the \"Gold Violin,\"] the scene with my wife, it was just so poignant and painful, someone said to me that what she loved about the episode was that we clearly did love each other. We were like the gold violin, we were beautiful but we just didn't make music\n\nCNN: What would you like to see Hollywood do?\n\nBatt: Continue to reward good work and put positive role models out there. The one thing about \"Brokeback Mountain\" -- it was a beautifully filmed and acted film depicting a tortured relationship. The reason I thought the movie was so great is people walked away thinking, \"Why couldn't they just be together?\"\n\nThe more positive or interesting the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters, the better. They should show people who are living their good, healthy, responsible, productive lives as role models who just happen to be gay.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the subject.\n\n@highlight\n\nActor Bryan Batt, who's openly gay, plays a closeted man in TV series \"Mad Men\"\n\n@highlight\n\nHomophobia that still exists in Hollywood is based on what will sell, Batt says\n\n@highlight\n\nHe believes positive, interesting portrayals of gays and lesbians are beneficial", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 143, "text": "in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "where does he play", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 385, "text": "\"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does Batt believe is beneficial?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 122, "text": "\"Mad Men,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What TV series does Bryan Batt act in?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 385, "text": "\"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does he beleive?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 31, "text": "plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who is bryan batt", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 385, "text": "\"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what does batt believe", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3947, "text": "homophobia"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What still exists in Hollywood, according to Batt?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1011, "text": "openly gay actor in Hollywood.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Eho is Bryan Batt?", "id": "./cnn/stories/37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Mike and Missy Wilson sat in a meeting late Tuesday afternoon, planning a ministry trip to Haiti when they were interrupted by a text message. A co-worker read the news: a powerful earthquake had just struck the Caribbean country.\n\nIn their Nashville, Tennessee, office, Mike Wilson said, \"My heart just dropped\" as he listened to the one-line bulletin. The quake's epicenter was a few miles from an orphanage in Carrefour, Haiti, where the Wilsons' 21-year-old daughter Katie was working, and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt lived.\n\n\"I felt like I couldn't take another breath,\" Missy Wilson said, \"I jumped up and yelled, 'This can't be happening.'\"\n\nThe first bits of news were discouraging, as sketchy reports came in of buildings collapsing and widespread destruction.\n\n\"It was horrible,\" Missy Wilson said. \"We spent hours trying to get any information.\"\n\nThe Brent Gambrell Ministries where she is director frequently works with churches and groups in Haiti. Any phone number they had in the country was quickly written on a board in the office.\n\n\"A group of 20 (people) sat and dialed the numbers over and over and over again.\"\n\n\"There are no words to explain that two people I love dearly were in the middle, and I couldn't reach then,\" Mike Wilson said, his voice cracking.\n\nBut it was more than 24 hours before they finally got word. A brief, scratchy call from their daughter Katie came through -- she and 5-year-old Tia had survived the quake that destroyed the orphanage. Missy Wilson said Katie was able to say, \"I'm alive. We're safe. Tia's safe. Please just know we're alive,\" before the 40-second call was cut off.\n\nIt would be Thursday before the Wilsons learned the whole story. Mike Wilson, with two ministry officials, was able to travel into Haiti on a medivac plane, and the three made their way to the town.\n\n\"There was destruction all around,\" he said from Haiti, \"When I saw what was left of that building, I knew they were protected.\"\n\nKatie, Tia and 47 other children all made it out, but were living in the parking lot across from the shattered orphanage. When Mike Wilson finally found his daughter, she ran up to him at full speed and hugged him. \"I can totally see her knocking him to the ground,\" her mother said.\n\nThe first order of business: a call home to a nervous mom. Wilson was able to get through on a rare working cell phone, and told his wife, \"need to you to hear something.\"\n\nMissy Wilson said the next words were from Tia, barely able to speak English, saying, \"'Ma-ma, I love you.' I started screaming at the top of my lungs.\"\n\nWilson and his colleagues brought food, water and supplies to the 200 quake victims in the parking lot. He described the injured, including one with a broken leg, being treated for two days in the heat with nothing more than an aspirin.\n\nThe group arranged a bus to take the children to a guest house, a trip delayed when the bus broke down. But that news was minor, knowing they would have shelter and supplies.\n\nFor the Wilsons, the next struggle is how to bring Tia home. They had been in Haiti just last week finishing paperwork for the adoption, but the office handling the case was destroyed in the quake. \"All that paperwork, God knows where it is,\" Mike Wilson said. \"That building was five stories, now it's five feet tall.\"\n\nFor Missy, waiting for news at home, \"I feel like I'm floating on top of my body.\"\n\n\"Like I'm living a dream and waiting to wake up,\" she said. This week has gone \"from hopelessness to hope to tears to 'I can't take another phone call because I don't know what will happen,'\" she said.\n\nWilson said he is working with the U.S. Embassy seeking emergency help to bring Tia to Nashville.\n\n\"We are going to do it,\" he said, his voice the strongest it had been all day.\n\n@highlight\n\nWilsons' 21-year-old daughter, and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt live in Haiti\n\n@highlight\n\n\"We spent hours trying to get any information,\" Missy Wilson says\n\n@highlight\n\nDaughters and 47 other children all made it out of orphanage alive\n\n@highlight\n\nFather traveled to Haiti on a medivac plane for joyous reunion", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 484, "text": "tie wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is Wilson's daughter?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 367, "text": "e quake's epicenter wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did the father travel to Haiti on?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 454, "text": "lsons' 21-year-old daughter Katie wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who was in Haiti?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 511, "text": "year-old gi"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What age was the girl they were about to adopt?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 426, "text": "rrefour, Haiti, wh"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where is the ophanage?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2030, "text": "r children all made it out, but w"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who made it out of the orphanage alive?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1823, "text": "plane"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did father travel?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 881, "text": "rmation.\"\\n\\nThe B"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did Missy Wilson spend hours trying to get?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b079b80cdc6c9a50bb0478c130e26305ffcddb29.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bee3a3c07d8b499437bf16f94361eedac9149780.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LONDON, England -- Evander Holyfield has raised the prospect of a rematch of his infamous world heavyweight title fight with Mike Tyson despite both men being into their 40s.\n\nHolyfield (right) grimaces after being bitten by Tyson in their 1997 fight.\n\nHolyfield took Tyson's crown in an epic bout in 1996, but it was their second fight a year later that is remembered for all the wrong reasons with Tyson disqualified for biting a chunk out of his opponent's ear.\n\nHolyfield, 45, has revealed he is considering an offer from 41-year-old Tyson's camp to meet in the ring for a third time. \"There has been some talk between us,\" Holyfield told The Guardian newspaper on Thursday.\n\n\"Mike had Jeff Fenech, who's been training him, call me a few months ago.

Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949.\n\nThe $5.3 billion arms package, announced last month, includes upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet.\n\nLast year, a similar deal prompted China to temporarily cut off military to military relations with Americans. This time, aside from some strong objections voiced by Beijing, Panetta said there has been no tangible action taken in response by China. \"I've heard nothing that indicates that they're taking any steps in reaction to that,\" Panetta said.\n\nPart of the reason might be the way the United States government handled the sales. \"It was something that the United States had announced but we had given the Chinese a heads up as to what was going to take place,\" Panetta said. \"I think in the end ... they handled it in a professional and diplomatic way and we appreciate that. \"\n\nThe South China Sea, a body of water east of Vietnam, north of Malaysia and west of the Philippines, has been a source of regional tensions for decades.

A 40-year-old man \"doesn't look like a minor,\" he added, suggesting that his partners were middle-aged men.\n\nHis actions, Mitterrand said, were \"without a doubt, an error,\" but \"a crime, no,\" he said in the interview.\n\nDespite recent calls to resign from the far-right National Front and the left-leaning Socialist Party, Mitterrand, who is openly gay, vowed to stay in his job. He said he met Thursday morning with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and that the president supports him.\n\nIn a July interview with the weekly French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, Sarkozy said he had read Mitterrand's book, and found it \"courageous and talented.\"\n\nThe controversy over the revelations in his book -- which he called neither autobiography nor memoir -- erupted anew after Mitterrand deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who fled the United States in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl.\n\nThe culture minister told TF1 that he was \"too emotional\" when he denounced the filmmaker's arrest in Switzerland as \"horrifying.\"\n\n\"To see him thrown to the lions for an old story that really has no meaning, and to see him alone, imprisoned, when he was going to attend a ceremony where he was to be honored, that is to say, he was trapped, it's absolutely horrifying,\" he said October 4, according to Agence France Presse.\n\nThe far-right National Front organized an anti-Mitterrand demonstration in Paris on Thursday evening.\n\n\"Send this message on to everyone who will not put up with this indecency!\" the party's Web site said.\n\nThe party's vice president, Marine Le Pen, has demanded Mitterrand's resignation for what she termed his sexually deviant acts. Mitterrand responded, saying, \"It's an honor to be dragged through the mud by the National Front.\"\n\nMitterrand's acts of \"sexual tourism\" have left \"a dark smudge\" on the government, Le Pen said.\n\nThe group is also gathering signatures on a petition, online and on paper, from those who want Mitterrand to step down.\n\n\"We really hope he will resign,\" National Front communications director Julien Sanchez told CNN.\n\n\"It's an embarrassment for our country, that our culture minister has done this. It affects our international image. It's not right,\" he added.  Watch report on the controversy surrounding French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterand »\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, the left-leaning Socialist Party suggested Sarkozy should consider Mitterrand's position.\n\n\"It's up to President Sarkozy to decide whether or not we can be involved in the fight against child prostitution and sexual tourism, and whether or not the acts written in an autobiography -- written by a minister -- are acts of sexual commerce,\" said party spokesman Benoit Hamon.\n\n\"If everything is relative and Mr. Mitterrand can be excused because he's famous, well, I don't excuse his behavior,\" Hamon said.\n\nMartine Aubry, the leader of the Socialist Party, said she would wait until she had read the book before making any judgment.\n\nMitterrand said on TF1 that he had had sexual relations with boys -- using the French word \"garcons\" -- but added, \"you must not confuse pedophilia with homosexuality.\"\n\nHe also described his book as a mixture of his life and the life of others, and denied accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism. The minister said he never had sex with \"young boys\" and denounced those who accused him of such acts, saying that maybe they were confusing their own fantasies with what the book was really about.\n\nMitterrand told an interviewer in 2005 that assertions that he liked \"little boys\" were untrue.\n\n\"It's because when people say 'boys' we imagine 'little boys,'\" he said then. \"How to explain that? It belongs to this general puritanism which surrounds us, which always makes us paint a black picture of the situation. It has nothing to do with that.\"\n\nMitterrand was a television personality, not a government minister, when the book was published. It caused a stir upon its publication, as well, and has been the subject of heated debate several times since then.\n\nIn one passage, published by the French newspaper Le Monde on Thursday, Mitterrand describes in detail a sexual encounter with a \"boy\" he said was called Bird.\n\n\"My boy didn't say a word, he stood before me, immobile, his eyes still straight ahead and a half-smile on his lips. I wanted him so badly I was trembling,\" he wrote.\n\nMitterrand also wrote about visiting clubs to choose young male prostitutes in Thailand -- where prostitution is illegal and sexual intercourse with a minor is statutory rape and is punishable by imprisonment.\n\n\"Most of them are young, handsome and apparently unaware of the devastation that their activities could bring them. I would learn later that they didn't come every night, that they were often students, had a girlfriend and sometimes even lived with their families, who pretended not to know the source of their breadwinner's earnings,\" the book said.\n\n\"Some of them were older and there was also a small contingent of heavier bruisers, who also had their fans. It was the artistic side of the exposition: Their presence made the youthful charm of the others stand out.\"\n\nHe also wrote that while he had read reports and seen documentaries on the evils of \"le commerce des garcons\" (the boy trade) -- the misery, the piles of money from which \"les gosses\" (the kids) got only a few crumbs, the ravages of drugs -- \"all of these rituals of the fair of the youths, the slave market, excited me enormously.\"\n\n\"The profusion of very attractive boys, immediately available, put me in a state of desire that I no longer had to restrain or conceal.\"\n\nMitterrand -- the nephew of the Socialist former president Francois Mitterrand -- joined Sarkozy's center-right government this summer.\n\nWikipedia, the user-edited online reference Web site, has locked down Mitterrand's entry, preventing changes to it, in a possible sign of the intensity of the debate surrounding him.\n\nCNN's Jen Carswell in Paris, France and Alanne Orjoux in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nCulture minister condemns sexual tourism, denies he is a pedophile\n\n@highlight\n\nFrederic Mitterrand, in 2005 book, wrote of paying for sex with \"boys\" in Thailand\n\n@highlight\n\nLe Monde on Thursday published steamy excerpts from \"The Bad Life\"\n\n@highlight\n\nMitterand came to the defense of Roman Polanski after the filmmaker's arrest", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 267, "text": "autobiography, \"The Bad Life.\"\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was published?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1656, "text": "deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what did he do for roman polanski", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 395, "text": "sexual tourism,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does hte minister condemn?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 148, "text": "paying to have sex with \"boys\" in Thailand.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what was written in the book", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 195, "text": "Frederic Mitterrand"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "WHo wrote the book?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1645, "text": "Mitterrand"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who came to the defense of Polanski after his arrest?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 4189, "text": "accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what has the culture minister denied", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 163, "text": "sex with \"boys\" in Thailand.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what does the culture minister deny?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 48, "text": "Frederic Mitterrand"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who published excerpts from the book?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a9a8ee9839b0dd6f8d716971b1bffa43f8b92216.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9b002a4c4dfb886ae6eb38b9b7eda0c8838e8e87.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Dr. Rajiv Shah President Obama announced Wednesday that Shah, the 36-year-old administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be in charge of the overall U.S. relief effort in Haiti. \"The goal of the relief effort in the first 72 hours will be very focused on saving lives,\" Shah said.\n\nAt Shah's USAID swearing-in ceremony on January 7, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \"One only needs to ask his wife, Shivam, the lengths to which Raj will go to achieve important goals.

His family did not reveal details about his illness, but said it was related to complications from a 1982 car accident, Barbaris said.\n\nThe crooner, affectionately known as just \"Teddy\" by many fans, started in music with a group called the Cadillacs in the late 1960s and was still with the group when it merged with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, according to his official Web site. He began as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer after the group heard his powerful voice. In 1972, Pendergrass' baritone could be heard on the classic Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song \"If You Don't Know Me by Now.\"\n\nAfter going solo, Pendergrass received several Grammy nominations, Billboard's 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award, and an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, Barbaris said. In 1982, Pendergrass was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed. But he returned to the studio in 1984 in his wheelchair to record an album.

Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news.\n\nSome of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.\n\nBut every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in.\n\nThey arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.\n\n@highlight\n\n36-year-old doctor, health administrator takes lead on U.S. effort in Haiti\n\n@highlight\n\nTelevangelist says Haitian pact with Satan brought on deadly earthquake\n\n@highlight\n\nRace to fill Ted Kennedy's Senate seat comes down to the wire", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 206, "text": "Haiti."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did the deadly earthquake happen?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9b002a4c4dfb886ae6eb38b9b7eda0c8838e8e87.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 206, "text": "Haiti."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did he lead the effort?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9b002a4c4dfb886ae6eb38b9b7eda0c8838e8e87.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2859, "text": "\" brought on the devastating earthquake in Haiti.\\n\\nOfficials fear mo"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did he say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9b002a4c4dfb886ae6eb38b9b7eda0c8838e8e87.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3383, "text": "ll serv"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is blamed for bringing on the deadly earthquake?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9b002a4c4dfb886ae6eb38b9b7eda0c8838e8e87.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "old doctor, health administrator takes lead", "id": "./cnn/stories/9b002a4c4dfb886ae6eb38b9b7eda0c8838e8e87.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.\n\nE-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals.\n\nKnown as \"e-cigarettes,\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum.\n\nWhile manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \"healthy way\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user.\n\n\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\" said Dr. Margaret A.

The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\"\n\nSamet and other health experts attended the FDA announcement on its findings.\n\nDr. Jonathan Winickoff, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium, said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes. \"It is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations, or even enforce rules that they not be used,\" he said.\n\n\"Children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products,\" said Dr. Matthew McKenna, director of the Office of Smoking and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general.\"\n\nThe FDA has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court. The FDA suggested health care professionals and consumers report serious side effects or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program either online, by regular mail, fax or phone.\n\nCNN's Valerie Willingham contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nFDA lab tests on e-cigarettes find carcinogens and other toxic chemicals\n\n@highlight\n\nE-cigarettes are battery operated, contain cartridges filled with nicotine, chemicals\n\n@highlight\n\nThey turn nicotine, chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user\n\n@highlight\n\nProduct had not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 169, "text": "they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did the FDA lab test find on e-cigarettes?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 174, "text": "contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Are e-cigarettes safe?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Do e-cigs have toxins?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 136, "text": "electronic cigarettes"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is battery operated and contains cartridges filled with nicotine and chemicals?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 708, "text": "vapor"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "They turn nicotine, chemicals into?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 103, "text": "popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "FDA lab tests on e-cigarettes find?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What does nicotine do?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3b0127dfee92f6afca19f34518a3b38a648322fc.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a6067be77650dacff1679be33f83df7053e6342c.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- A man suspected of killing five members of his family and wounding another on Thursday committed suicide after police surrounded him in a house, police in Cleveland, Ohio, said Friday.\n\nPolice say Davon Crawford, 33, killed his new wife, her sister and three children.\n\nActing on a tip, police surrounded the house and then entered it after seeing a man who matched the description of suspect Davon Crawford briefly step outside, police spokesman Lt.

Brunn was pronounced dead at a hospital at 5:37 p.m. due to an apparent suicide, she said.\n\nThe case since has been referred to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, according to Stancil.\n\nBrunn had entered a guilty plea Tuesday at a hearing in a Cherokee County courthouse, during which he described in detail how he enticed, molested and killed 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole, avoiding a potential death sentence by lethal injection.\n\nThe girl's father, Ricardo Galarza, told CNN en Espanol that news of Brunn's death partly made him \"feel good but, on the other hand, it doesn't because my daughter will never be with me again.\"\n\nGalarza said that he felt that a lifetime of Brunn being watched after, \"eating three times a day (and) sleeping with air conditioning\" while in prison was not enough.\n\n\"What I wanted was for them to put him in the electric chair and burn him,\" the father said. \"I would have taken him there myself and prepared it, so he would burn.\"\n\nJorelys' mangled body was found in a trash compactor three days after she went missing on December 2 from an apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Jorelys was severely beaten and stabbed repeatedly in the face, neck and chest.\n\nBrunn, 20, who worked as a maintenance man at the same apartment complex, was arrested on December 7 and charged with the crime.\n\nLast week, Brunn was indicted on 13 counts including murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to children, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes, false imprisonment, abandonment of a dead body, making a false statement and sexual exploitation of children.\n\nHe told the court Tuesday that he had never talked to Jorelys before the day of her murder. He said he devised a plan after he found one of her skates.\n\nBrunn took a picture of the skate and approached her with it, asking if the skate was hers. She said yes, and Brunn promised to take her to it.\n\nInstead, he took her to an empty apartment and instructed Jorelys to pull down her pants. He then put tape over her face and cut her throat with a razor. At this point, she was still alive, he told the court.\n\nHe said that he then took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate. He said he did not have sex with the girl.\n\nIncreasingly, Brunn told the court, he grew concerned about what he had done. So he took a receipt, wrote on the back of it, \"She is in the trash can,\" and taped it to the compactor.\n\nHe admitted lying to investigators who had questioned him about the case. Brunn said he knew right from wrong, adding he \"never had an idea of killing a child in my life.\"\n\n\"I'd like to apologize for everything I've done, and I do deserve everything that you're about to give me,\" he said in court.\n\n@highlight\n\nVictim's father says he would have preferred Brunn die \"in the electric chair\"\n\n@highlight\n\nRyan Brunn died of an apparent suicide, a Georgia corrections spokeswoman says\n\n@highlight\n\nHe pleaded guilty Tuesday in the murder of 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera\n\n@highlight\n\nThe girl was found dead in a trash compactor three days after she went missing", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 17, "text": "Ryan Brunn,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who was found dead?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9664c072917307f3804f49a66550f5fb3de09475.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 777, "text": "s Rivera.

Dr. William Petit, although severely beaten, managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor's residence.\n\nHayes was sentenced to death in December, after being convicted of 16 out of the 17 charges related to the three deaths.\n\nBoth suspects had lengthy criminal records when they were arrested for the Petit invasion. Komisarjevsky's long rap sheet, in particular, suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth.\n\nOfficials with the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to speak with CNN, citing a gag order in the case. But over 200 pages of Komisarjevsky's parole records have been released, which -- along with previous court testimony -- help paint a picture of the accused.\n\nOne of his former attorneys, William Gerace, said that Komisarjevsky came from a close, religious family. But at the age of 14, he began using drugs -- the same year, he claims, that he found out that he was adopted.\n\nBy 18, Komisarjevsky had found his drugs of choice: crystal meth and cocaine. He told the parole board that he stole money and electronics from upscale homes to feed his drug habit.\n\nYet a transcript from his 2002 sentencing paints Komisarjevsky as more than just the average thief. According to a police statement read aloud in court that day, Komisarjevsky admitted that he broke into his first house when he was 14 years old.\n\n\"I always wore gloves, with the exception of one incident when I was 14. I always acted alone. Approximately a year and a half ago, I acquired night vision goggles... I used the night-vision equipment during the burglaries (over) the past year,\" he said, according to the transcript.\n\nGerace, who was Komisarjevsky's defense attorney at the time, stressed that a need for money, to pay for drugs, drove his client. But he admitted that the way he went about it was unusual.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of burglaries are (committed by) junkies -- there's nothing romantic about what they do,\" said Gerace. \"That was the first time I'd seen something as exotic as that.\"\n\nKomisarjevsky confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial. They said his affinity for breaking into people's homes at night showed that he wanted a confrontation, since that was the time when the residents were the most likely to be at home.\n\nSpeaking during his December 2002 sentencing, Komisarjevsky appeared repentant. He addressed the court saying, \"I've turned my back on my faith in God and my family. And in doing so, I fell flat on my face and deep into hard drugs...the crimes I committed was weighing so heavily on my shoulders.\"\n\nBut the judge was not moved by Komisarjevsky's show of remorse, sentencing him to nine years in prison plus six years of special parole, which has greater restrictions than typical probation.\n\nIn April 2007, he was paroled. And three months later, Komisarjevsky was arrested for the Petit home invasion and murders.\n\nWhat happened then, and what may have driven Komisarjevsky, remains a mystery to Gerace, his former attorney.\n\n\"He was a very complex young man. I don't think I've met anyone quite that complex, and I sensed there was an abundance of issues that had to be dealt with,\" Gerace said. \"I wish him well, and I hope the jury makes the right decision.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nJoshua Komisarjevsky was convicted in 2002 on 12 counts of burglary\n\n@highlight\n\nFive years later, after being released on parole, he was accused of murder\n\n@highlight\n\nProsecutors say he killed a Connecticut woman and set a fire that killed her daughters", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 162, "text": "2002,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "In what year was he convicted?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1ee1a82d6b5845a29f936ea298a12213732393c1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 698, "text": "Petit and her daughters -- 17-"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who did he kill", "id": "./cnn/stories/1ee1a82d6b5845a29f936ea298a12213732393c1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 226, "text": "12 counts of burglary.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "WHat was Joshua convicted of?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1ee1a82d6b5845a29f936ea298a12213732393c1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 162, "text": "2002,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "when was he convicted", "id": "./cnn/stories/1ee1a82d6b5845a29f936ea298a12213732393c1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 358, "text": "rder charges, an"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was Joshua Komisarjevsky accused of five years later?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1ee1a82d6b5845a29f936ea298a12213732393c1.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1692, "text": "ly.

It's not a nice way to lose.\n\n\"The people that step up are brave enough to step up and if you score, great and if you miss it's hard to take, but it just wasn't our night,\" Beckham added.\n\nBeckham is due to return to AC Milan in January for another loan spell as he bids to secure a place in England's World Cup squad for next year's finals in South Africa.\n\nThe English midfielder's future in the U.S. had appeared in doubt earlier in the season when his commitment was called into question following a loan spell with the Italian club during which he had indicated an apparent desire to continue playing in Italy.\n\nBeckham had earlier said that playing in Sunday's final ranked alongside winning the Primera Liga title with Real Madrid in 2003 and a trophy-laden spell at Manchester United that included six English Premier League titles and the 1999 Champions League crown.\n\n\"Anytime you reach a certain part of the season, whether it's being in a cup final or winning leagues, it's always special,\" Beckham said. \"Being involved in finals never gets old.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nGalaxy strike first, with Mike Magee scoring in the 41st minute\n\n@highlight\n\nRobbie Findley nets Real Salt Lake's only goal as games ends 1-1\n\n@highlight\n\nBeckham scores in shootout but Galaxy lose 5-4\n\n@highlight\n\nBeckham is due to return to AC Milan in January on loan", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2172, "text": "January"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "In what month is Beckham expected to return?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 199, "text": "1-1.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the final result of Real Salt Lake's game?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2132, "text": "Beckham is due to return to AC Milan in January"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "when is going to return beckham to ac milan?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 207, "text": "Robbie Russell"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who netted Real Salt Lake's goal?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 706, "text": "midfielder Mike Magee"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who scored in the 41st minute?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2132, "text": "Beckham"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is going to return to AC Milan?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 95, "text": "5-4"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the score in the Galaxy game?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 739, "text": "41st-minute"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "in what minute make magee score?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2160, "text": "AC Milan"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "where is going to return beckham?", "id": "./cnn/stories/545574e8b8cac6ac72a030dc65862cfb58804340.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- Skier Paul Wampach, a 49-year-old manager from Chicago, Illinois, hardly matches the stereotype of a hostel dweller: an under-30 backpacker from outside the United States who can't afford fancy lodging.\n\nTravelers looking to meet new people might consider staying at hostels, say experts.\n\nFor the fifth time in two years, Wampach plans to head to the Fireside Inn in Breckenridge, Colorado, where he's booked a dorm-style room for less than $40 a night during his ski vacation.\n\n\"If I'm traveling by myself, there's no reason to splurge,\" said Wampach, who is single and described himself as neither rich nor poor. \"That $40 or $50 [I save on lodging] goes to food, beer and ski-lift tickets.\" And amenities such as Internet access and a hot tub at the hostel add creature comforts to the trip.\n\nWampach's travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called \"flashpackers.\"\n\nThey are usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but instead choose budget options -- albeit better-furnished and well-kept ones -- because it fits their lifestyle, said Mark Vidalin, Marketing Director for Hostelling International USA, a nonprofit network of hostels. Flashpackers also tend to stay connected by traveling with gadgets and seeking accommodations with free Wi-Fi, Vidalin said.\n\nThe term \"flashpacker\" likely originated in Australia, and combines the term \"flash\" -- meaning \"stylish\" -- with \"backpacker,\" according to Vidalin.\n\nFlashpackers and regular backpackers are booking hostels at U.S. vacation destinations in full force this year. Attendance at hostels has been consistently rebounding from lows following the September 11, 2001.\n\nThis year's turbulent economy appears to be fueling demand for hostel space.\n\nHeading into ski season, Loree Weisman, the owner of the Crested Butte International Lodge and Hostel in Crested Butte, Colorado, said her hostel bookings are trending ahead of the town's other lodging options -- and up about 25 percent from her bookings by the same time last year.\n\nAmid the unsteady economy, she said, people \"don't want to give up a vacation, but they might need to adapt a vacation.\"\n\nInstead of canceling pricey vacations due to economic fears, many travelers are rejecting accommodations with private bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nThey're going for hostels with their dorm-style bunk beds, community bathrooms, and, most importantly for many hostel dwellers, shared living spaces.\n\n\"There's a sense of community, and there's a social aspect to it that's pretty significant,\" said Jim Williams, editor of \"The Hostel Handbook\" and a former hostel owner. \"That is the heart of hostelling. You don't go to a hotel and lock the door.\"\n\nWampach agreed, saying that hostels offer \"a tremendous way to meet people from different cultures and talk to people you wouldn't normally talk to.\"\n\nBut the communal atmosphere of hostels leaves many travelers skeptical, particularly Americans, Williams said.\n\n\"Americans have privacy issues. If you suggested to most people they were going to share a room with five other people, most of them wouldn't want to do it,\" he said.\n\nWhat if a roommate snores or what if he smells or doesn't stop talking? -- these are legitimate questions for travelers considering the hostel option, said Williams.\n\nFrequent hostel dweller Mandy Creighton, 30, said she enjoys the overall hostel experience, but it's a \"huge challenge\" to \"walk through the room and to my room without having to talk to 20 people.\"\n\nCreighton and her partner, Ryan Mlynarczyk, 32, who are documentary filmmakers from Sebastopol, California, are bicycling around the United States for a year and stopping in ecologically sustainable communities along the way.\n\nTheir choice to stay in hostels is rooted in a desire to maintain a green lifestyle by sharing resources as well as saving money.\n\nMlynarczyk experienced the other side of the privacy issue when he stepped out of a shower in a San Francisco, California, hostel to discover he had a female audience.\n\n\"I ... didn't have my towel on -- and some girl walks in and was like, 'Woo!' I'm totally open to that sort of thing, but I think she was a little bit new to it, and she kind of was giggling. But obviously the immediate reaction was, 'Oh my God!' \" Mlynarczyk said.\n\nIn contrast to Americans who treasure their personal space, the communal environment is more ingrained in European culture, experts said.\n\nIt's possible to trace that cultural divide to post-World War II, said Williams, when Europe underwent its financial recovery in the 1950s and its culture was more communal. On the other hand, the U.S. economy was booming, and there was no need for Americans to share resources.\n\n\"At the same time [Europeans] were creating hostels, American teenagers were focused on getting their own cars,\" Williams said.\n\nNevertheless, Hostelling International reported its hostels in many destination cities saw notable increases in October versus the same time last year: New York overnight guests increased by 9.8 percent, Washington by 9.7 percent and San Diego, California, by 22.1 percent, according to Hostelling International.\n\nDespite the rise in many hostel bookings, Williams said hostelling still isn't part of mainstream American culture.\n\n\"We do hostelling about as well as we do soccer. We do it, but it's a limited market, and we do it a certain way. Otherwise, most Americans aren't very comfortable [with] it,\" Williams said.\n\nWampach said he believes this represents Americans' \"relatively conservative views and lifestyles.\"\n\nBut people are respectful of each other's space, he said, and they rarely spend time together in the dorm room aside from sleeping anyway.\n\n\"You just do your best; everybody understands you are who are,\" Wampach said. \"Sometimes you get a guy who snores but ... that's part of the deal.\"\n\n@highlight\n\n\"Flashpackers\" are professionals older than 30 who prefer hostels to hotels\n\n@highlight\n\nHostels in New York, Washington and San Diego, California, report increased guests\n\n@highlight\n\nSense of community is the \"heart of hostelling,\" expert says\n\n@highlight\n\nMany Americans uncomfortable with hostels' lack of privacy", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 815, "text": "Wampach's travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called \"flashpackers.\"\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are \"flashpackers\"?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3018, "text": "\"Americans have privacy issues."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Are Americans comfortable about hostels ?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What about hostels do many Americans find uncomfortable?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1510, "text": "and regular backpackers are booking hostels at U.S. vacation destinations"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are flashpackers?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2908, "text": "the communal atmosphere of hostels"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are many Americans uncomfortable with?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2499, "text": "\"There's a sense of community, and there's a social aspect to it that's pretty significant,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the \"heart of hostelling\"?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 815, "text": "Wampach's travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called \"flashpackers.\"\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is a \"flashpacker\" ?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1848, "text": "Crested Butte International Lodge and Hostel in Crested Butte, Colorado,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the heart of hostelling?", "id": "./cnn/stories/346bb8388ba574679ea898c11075de07a786f817.story"}]}]}]}
