High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.\n\n\"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years.

I really can't believe this,\" Tutu said. \"You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said.\n\nVisa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said.\n\nHowever, South Africa's foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa.\n\n\"South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision,\" according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration.\n\nThe Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nTutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa's government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.\n\n\"You are disgraceful,\" Tutu said about the government. \"You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood.\"\n\nThe ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter.\n\nBut he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.\n\nThis is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend.\n\nIn refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.\n\n\"We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,\" presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.\n\nSpeculation surfaced Tuesday that this year's visit was also affected by South Africa's relationship with China.\n\nSouth African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.\n\nMotlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.\n\nBut Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.\n\n\"We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest,\" Monyela said.\n\nThe Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: \"Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so.\"\n\nKim Norgaard, CNN's Johannesburg bureau chief,

He said very clearly: 'If any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily,' \" the pope wrote, quoting the Gospel of Luke.\n\nJesus, the pope wrote, \"suffered in place of man and for man.

Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing \"with his own voice, in his own way.\"\n\nMurdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called \"interesting but unfair.\"\n\nThese were followed by praise for cinema releases \"We Bought a Zoo,\" and \"The Descendants,\" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year.\n\n\"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,\" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: \"Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).\"\n\nOthers claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. \"You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,\" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers.\n\nA spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine.\n\nThe account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures.\n\nTwitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down.\n\nMurdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie.\n\nThere were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the \"most humble day day of my life\" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. \"My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!\"\n\nBut there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of \"tweeting-before-thinking\" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a \"broke country.\"\n\nThe message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: \"RUPERT!!! delete tweet!\" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: \"EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!\" [sic]\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page.\n\nAmong other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.\n\n@highlight\n\nRupert Murdoch has notched up more than 45,000 followers after joining Twitter\n\n@highlight\n\nMurdoch's tweets so far focus on family, politics and cinema releases\n\n@highlight\n\n80-year-old's social media appearance called a PR stunt by some\n\n@highlight\n\nNews Corp. official confirms to CNN that account is genuine", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 330, "text": ",000 fo"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many followers does Rupert have?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 330, "text": ",000 fo"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many followers does Murdoch have on twitter?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 271, "text": "mily, work and politics, Mu"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What do his tweets talk about?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 388, "text": "-year-old wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is his age?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 388, "text": "-year-old wa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what age is the person?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 265, "text": "out family, work and politics, Mu"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What types of tweets does Murdoch write?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1763, "text": "t is"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which news channel was this information confirmed to?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 320, "text": "re than 45,000 fo"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is number of followers Murdoch has?", "id": "./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/55a73732ee579bfe39a20ad66d190c4bf6ebfe9c.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Jeremy Piven is the kind of guy who can make you laugh just by lifting an eyebrow.\n\nJeremy Piven stars as a used car salesman in \"The Goods.\" He says \"Entourage\" would make a great film.\n\nOf course, the popular actor can do much more than that to captivate audiences.\n\nFrom drama to comedy, Piven has starred in more than 40 films on the big screen and has won critical acclaim for his role as super agent Ari Gold on HBO's \"Entourage.\" (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)\n\nPiven stopped by the CNN.com newsroom to talk with CNN's Nicole Lapin about his new film, \"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,\" in which he plays a used car salesman.\n\nThe following is an edited version of the interview:\n\nCNN: [The movie] was hysterical, and my producer and I were sitting next to each other and we were trying to figure out -- is this like lowbrow, but it's smart, so it's medium-brow? Highbrow comedy?\n\nJeremy Piven: It's a hybrid-brow, or a unibrow.

So that when Will jumps out of the plane, he takes us to a whole other level -- it's like, \"Oh my God, Will Ferrell is so brilliant.\" But the reality is, the movie was so funny up until that moment that it was really, it was kind of organic, and it sustained it and it was really fantastic.  Watch why part of Piven's interview had to be bleeped out »\n\nJames Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, \"James, is she OK with all this?\" Because he has one of the most twisted roles you've ever seen, as you know -- and I don't want to give it away. He was like, \"Well, the wife is on the fence about this whole thing,\" and she came to a screening and I swear to God, Babs laughed the loudest.\n\nCNN: I think that's a tease in itself.

So I kind of took that, and I reversed it and I'm no longer a sucker.\n\nCNN: Are you going to stick with \"Entourage\"?\n\nPiven: Well, I think \"Entourage\" ... this season is the sixth season, and it's I think the most interesting of all of them, and I kind of have the best arc this year.\n\nThe backstage life of Hollywood is such fertile stuff for our show that I think we could continue on for as long as it stays fresh.\n\nCNN: What about a movie?\n\nPiven: I think a movie would be really, really fun of \"Entourage.\" I'd love to open it up.

They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives.\n\nBut authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport.\n\nThey do not have the laptop case, they said.\n\nThey are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt.\n\nPolice earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went. It was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation.\n\nPolice did not know which flight the man was booked on.\n\nPart of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled, but was later reopened.\n\nAll planes in the area of Terminal 2, where the incident took place, were evacuated and all luggage was removed, police said. The passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened, an airport representative told CNN, adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally.\n\nAbout 100 flights were affected by the security measures. Some were canceled and others were delayed, the airport said, adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal.\n\nThe airport Web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving Terminal 2 several hours after the incident.\n\nThe incident took place as a United States Senate committee debated the foiled Christmas Day attack aboard a plane bound from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThe committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said it is \"infuriating\" that the December 25 suspect, Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was able to board the plane in the Netherlands with a U.S. visa.\n\nJanet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said AbdulMutallab \"was not on the no-fly list, which would've flagged him to be prevented from boarding, nor was he on the selectee list, which would've flagged him for secondary screening.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in Nigeria and the Netherlands did not detect explosives on his body,\" Napolitano said. \"As this incident underscores, aviation security is increasingly an international responsibility.\"\n\nShe said top Homeland Security Department officials are embarking on a multicontinent tour to meet with international counterparts about airline and airport security.

Fashion as a whole is feeling a greater level of lost revenues and in turn has lost opportunities for sustaining volume and even more so for growth,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst and expert fashion analyst for the NPD market research group.\n\n\"The ironic thing is that new ideas and creations are just what the industry needs but is too cautious to react to it,\" he added.\n\nFull of new ideas, student designers say they are aware of the challenges as they head out into the work force, but they're optimistic they can make it in these tough times.\n\n\"After I graduate, I'm going to New York, I have an internship lined up with a trend forecasting company, Promostyl,\" said Shelby Simon whose designs made it into SCAD's annual fashion show.

She would like to land an internship in New York and has interviewed with New York & Co. and applied for positions at Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Zac Posen.\n\nToledo, a world-renown designer, knows it can be tough to make it in fashion. She and her fashion illustrator husband Ruben Toledo didn't have much money when they arrived from Cuba in the late 60s as political refugees. She says she found inspiration in the little things.  Experts' advice on getting to top of fashion business »\n\n\"Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn't do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up,\" said Isabel Toledo.\n\nToledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nBut for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrouël and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway.\n\nAzrouël, a self-taught designer, says it's a tough industry and students have to pay their dues.\n\n\"It's not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later.\"\n\nMore known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrouël taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs.\n\n\"If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it,\" advised Azrouël.\n\nSCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams.\n\n\"Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said 'Ah, there's something not right with this dress' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it,\" said Clarke.\n\nNilsson enjoyed the process.\n\n\"I really tried to spend a lot of time seeing what they [the students] had to say, giving them advice and push them forward to express themselves,\" said Nilsson. \"It's been a great collaboration, and I must say that I've learned a lot myself, too.\"\n\nThe visiting designers give the students an edge in their job search, says SCAD president Paula Wallace. \"It's very important to bring in the top professionals because they inspire the students and they provide contacts and networking for the students after they graduate.\"\n\nStudents are also using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace to reach out to their peers and other industry professionals.

Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle.\n\nLes Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.\n\nJuszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music »\n\nCNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul.\n\nHenry Juszkiewicz: I've been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary.\n\nIn the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful.\n\nCNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul »\n\nJuszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson's parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality.\n\nAnd they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn't until 1965, '66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early '60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that's sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959.\n\nSo Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ...\n\nThe [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the '50s and before the '50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that's kind of normal today. ...\n\nCNN: Les Paul being Les Paul, I assumed he continue to play with things over the years.\n\nJuszkiewicz: Yeah, he would call me all the time and give me suggestions. It's really hard to answer your original question, what makes it [distinctive]. ... As a guitar player, when I pick it up, I know it's a Les Paul. I can feel the sustain. It's got a certain feeling. ... There's a lot of things in it. But it's the package that's kind of magic. In the modern world, working with modern equipment, it's incomparable.\n\nCNN: How many Les Pauls do you sell nowadays?\n\nJuszkiewicz: A lot. Many, many thousands.\n\nI'll share with you: We had a big debate when we first got involved in the business. When I was a young guitar player, Les Pauls were always very expensive ... and they're very expensive today. [Paul] said, \"You know, Henry, you really have to make a less expensive Les Paul.\" ... We argued about it for a year and a half, and finally I gave in. I said, \"OK, Les, it's your guitar.\" ...\n\nAnd it was an instant success. And all of a sudden, people that couldn't touch that magic got a shot at it, and he was pleased as punch, and we were as well.\n\nHe was a renaissance man. ... What a life. And what a wonderful, warm gentleman.\n\n@highlight\n\nGibson CEO: Les Paul made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars\n\n@highlight\n\nLes Pauls weren't particularly popular when introduced\n\n@highlight\n\nPaul, legendary guitarist and inventor, died Thursday at 94", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 639, "text": "Thursday"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "when does paul died?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1920, "text": "a solid-body guitar"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what wasn't particularly popular when introduced?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 70, "text": "Les Paul"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who made recommendations on how to improve guitars?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1377, "text": "Gibson Les Paul"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What wasn't popular when introduced?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 625, "text": "Les Paul"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who died on thursday at 94", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 669, "text": "94.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was Paul's age at death?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What did the gibson ceo say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 117, "text": "on how to improve guitars,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what was the recommendations of les paul?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7843646a31a1ca87834dc4c72a092bf6c693baff.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4d181b23eb2a5c73f17f6c6c8856ad246041af95.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "United Nations (CNN) -- Confronted with the prospect of a Palestinian bid for full U.N. membership, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a sharp rebuke Wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the Arab world.\n\n\"Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,\" Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. \"If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now.\"\n\nThe United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East.\n\nA formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday.\n\n\"One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine,\" Obama added. \"I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves.\"\n\nA year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, \"the parties have not bridged their differences,\" Obama said.\n\nThe American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries \"unbreakable,\" a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape.\n\nThough Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama's speech, he called the U.S. position a \"badge of honor,\" and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem.\n\nPeace negotiations broke down last year.\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said.\n\nAbbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken \"very seriously,\" according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon.\n\nBan said it will \"not take long\" to get Security Council consideration.\n\nShaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want \"anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness,\" he said.\n\nPalestinians' current status at the United Nations is as an observer \"entity.\" Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.\n\nWhile a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a \"yes\" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer \"state,\" the status the Vatican currently holds.\n\nAbbas' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would \"deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland.\"\n\nAs national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence.\n\nArgentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that \"non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity.\"\n\nThe Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nThey say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.\n\nAbbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council.\n\nAbbas' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly's 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid.\n\nHer speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as \"the century of women.\"\n\nAlso Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said.\n\nThe U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change.\n\n\"Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight,\" said Ban. \"Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets.\"\n\nThirty-one of the world body's 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week.\n\nBrazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II.\n\nCNN's Elise Labott, Richard Roth, Alan Silverleib and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nNEW: Obama completes meeting with Abbas\n\n@highlight\n\nThe Palestinian leader says he does not expect the U.N. to act immediately\n\n@highlight\n\nArgentina's president: \"Non-inclusion of Palestine ... will create greater insecurity\"\n\n@highlight\n\nFrance's president says a veto could spark violence", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3816, "text": "r state, calling for a more definitive time"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did the French president say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/4d181b23eb2a5c73f17f6c6c8856ad246041af95.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 128, "text": "issued a sharp rebuke"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did Obama do?", "id": "./cnn/stories/4d181b23eb2a5c73f17f6c6c8856ad246041af95.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1272, "text": "e Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who did Obama meet with?", "id": "./cnn/stories/4d181b23eb2a5c73f17f6c6c8856ad246041af95.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3798, "text": "ine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month?\n\n2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history?\n\n3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers?\n\nLearning Activities\n\nUse these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.\n\n1. A Milestone in U.S. History\n\nRemind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving.\n\n2. Covering Black History\n\nAsk students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.\n\n3. Harlem Renaissance\n\nInform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.\n\nHave each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as \"roaming curators\" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.\n\n4. Profiles in Black History\n\nDo your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.\n\n5. Local African-American History\n\nValuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.\n\n6. Black History Museum\n\nCelebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?\n\n7. Not Just for February\n\nInform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long.

A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net.\n\nCameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in.\n\nEmad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time.\n\nHowever, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals.\n\nThe first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption.\n\nThe second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground.\n\nHowever, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango.\n\nNeither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday.\n\nGoalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia.\n\nEnyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia.\n\nObefemi Martins, Victor Nsofor, Peter Odemwingie, and John Obi Mikel all scored for Nigeria.\n\n@highlight\n\nDefending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinal in Angola\n\n@highlight\n\nEgypt score two goals in extra time to secure a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon on Monday\n\n@highlight\n\nNigeria become the fourth team tor each the last four stage, setting up a clash with rivals Ghana", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2794, "text": "ifinals after defeating Zambia in a"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what did nigeria become", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 89, "text": "Egypt"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "WHo booked their place", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3060, "text": "sday.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who does Nigeria play?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 89, "text": "Egypt"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who are the defending champions?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "what did egypt do", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 166, "text": "3-1"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "how many goals did egypt score", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3086, "text": "t Enyeama"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What day was the game", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 119, "text": "African Nations Cup semifinals"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the competition", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 9, "text": "Two"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Egypt scored how many goals?", "id": "./cnn/stories/6011397b58f7f30ed13de7b9a282d475d963eba6.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/ecb913720a8246ed20658de2299afe941bb3b293.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A soldier who reported for duty with her children in tow has been granted her request for a discharge, her lawyer said Monday.\n\nLisa Pagan was recalled to the Army after being honorably discharged four years ago.\n\nLisa Pagan, of Davidson, North Carolina, reported for duty Monday morning at Fort Benning, Georgia, with her two preschool children.

The company, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes, donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month.\n\nWith food banks across the country reporting shortages of food, the donation was a welcome one, said the food bank's director of development, Christopher Wiley. It took only two weeks for about 3,000 boxes to move through warehouse.\n\n\"Thousands of families benefited from the donation\" Wiley said. \"It was a surprise to us. We were lacking a lot of cereal. It is a great product many low-income families really need.\"\n\n\"The real story for us was not the box but what's inside the box. The food is so valuable for the community. It's making good from bad,\" Wiley said.\n\nThe food bank has seen a 6 percent increase in its customer base since the beginning of the year, he said.\n\nPhelps, 23, won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China.\n\nHe admitted \"regrettable behavior\" after a British newspaper published the controversial photograph in early February.

Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic.\n\n\"I just want to know why, why he would do this,\" Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday. \"He took care of me, good care of me. I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house.\"\n\n\"I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he didn't kill me, but he killed all these girls,\" she said.\n\nSowell, 50, is facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All the victims were African-American women. All that remains of one of them is a skull, wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement.\n\nSowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989. He was released in 2005.\n\nSo far, nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell's home have been identified. The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, police said. They are Janice Webb, 49, and Kim Yvette Smith, who was 43 when last seen. Both women were from Cleveland.\n\nWebb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2, police said. Smith was last seen January 1, but was not reported missing until November 2.\n\nA grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36-year-old woman September 22, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release. The investigation into that incident was what led police, armed with a search warrant, to Sowell's home, where they discovered the bodies late last month.\n\nThe alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood, and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, prosecutors said. \"While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness,\" the statement said. \"When she regained consciousness, he led her out of the house.\"\n\nSowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident, along with two counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault, authorities said.\n\nSowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday, authorities said.\n\nThe charges are first-degree felonies except for the assault charges, which are second-degree felonies, prosecutors said. If convicted, he would face a sentence of up to life in prison.\n\nThe investigation into the homicides continues, prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release.\n\n\"Upon completion of the investigation, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell.\"\n\nResidents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood, but assumed it was from nearby Ray's Sausage Company.\n\nAsked whether she had noticed a foul odor, Frazier told WOIO, \"Yeah, I smelled stuff, but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs. And then I guess after she left, he told me that it was Ray's Sausage.\"\n\nFrazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there.\n\n\"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,\" Jackson said in a written statement.\n\n\"As a family, we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago. My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention, closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal.\"\n\nHundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims.\n\n\"It's hard, because I want to burn it down,\" said Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia, 31 and a mother of three children, is among the dead.\n\nSowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell's public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step.\n\nPolice recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell's home to follow up on a rape accusation.\n\nIn a separate incident, neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. But the woman told officers that she was at the home \"partying,\" when she fell off the roof, and no charges were filed.\n\nAgents from the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes.\n\n\"Our experts tell us it's likely he's done this before,\" said Frank Figliuzzi, special agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland office. \"He's probably done it elsewhere, and so we need to determine whether or not he's responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country.\"\n\nIn addition, the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad, Figliuzzi said.\n\n\"We know, for example, he was a Marine, he was assigned to California, he served in Okinawa, Japan, and we'll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database, and we'll specifically be looking at those locations where he's previously lived.\"\n\nAllen Sowell, the suspect's half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said.\n\nThe stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn't paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004.  Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said.\n\nAllen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother's prison record, but \"just couldn't fathom\" the accusations now facing him.\n\n\"I didn't think he was in that bad of a mental state,\" Allen Sowell said. \"You never think it would happen to your family. It's a horrible feeling.\"\n\nAt 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9.\n\nHe added, \"He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system.\"\n\nCNN's Susan Candiotti, Edmund Demarche and Ross Levitt and CNN Radio's Brendan Gage contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nNEW: Mayor Frank Jackson: \"I love my niece very much ... she has my full support\"\n\n@highlight\n\nNEW: FBI says it's likely suspect has \"done this before;\" looking at places he lived in past\n\n@highlight\n\nLori Frazier, mayor's niece, says she lived with Anthony Sowell from 2005 to 2007\n\n@highlight\n\nSowell charged with murder, rape, other crimes after 11 bodies found at home", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3544, "text": "\"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did Frank Jackson say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What does Jackson say of his niece?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "With who has Lori Frazier been living between 2005 and 2007?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 154, "text": "murder"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is Sowell charged with?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What the FBI said?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 261, "text": "Lori Frazier,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who Jackson loves?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who did Lori Frazier live with?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 154, "text": "murder"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what is Anthony Sowell charged with?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 702, "text": "from 2005 to 2007"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When did Lori Frazier live with Anthony Sowell?", "id": "./cnn/stories/d2b1578751b94be2482d620e7e312e36440a66f8.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9e7d78ba97bc674e69bc02f31c8ad0a7dc87406d.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Authorities are seeking the public's assistance in identifying a teenage girl who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home -- or even her own name.\n\nThe teen has recalled an excerpt from the fantasy novel \"Fool's Fate\" by Robin Hobb.\n\n\"I just want to know who I am,\" the girl says in a statement released by the New York City Administration for Children's Services.

Oakley is also charged with converting the material and \"restricted data\" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them.\n\nOakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods \"into little pieces\" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance.\n\nThe government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the \"pieces of scrap\" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an \"appliance\" under the law.\n\n\"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,\" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.\n\nEach count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n\"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement.\n\nOne government source said the materials involved are not the \"crown jewels,\" but they should not have been taken from the facility.\n\nA \"barrier\" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.\n\nSources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material.\n\nOakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said.\n\nA government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.\n\nThe FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country.\n\nEast Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation \"where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,\" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. \"When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium.\"\n\nBoyd said the technology park and the reservation \"are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position.\"\n\nIn this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and \"successfully identified the individual in question,\" he said.

Jackson died June 25 after collapsing at his rented home in Los Angeles.\n\nAEG, promoter of Jackson's planned London, England, shows, released the short video of Jackson rehearsing in the arena on June 23.\n\nJackson sang \"They Don't Care About Us,\" a song from his \"HIStory\" album, as he danced along with eight male dancers.

The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications.\n\nPolice did not say whether they found anything.\n\nMurray's attorneys issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner's tests are complete.\n\n\"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson,\" the statement said. \"We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo.\"\n\nNo public showing planned for Neverland\n\nLogistical and financial challenges derailed earlier plans for a public viewing and private memorial at Neverland Ranch.\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the Santa Barbara County ranch, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\nLaw enforcement sources had said a public viewing at the ranch was under consideration for Friday, but a spokesman for the family said that it would not happen.\n\n\"Plans are under way regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly,\" said Ken Sunshine, whose public relations firm had been hired by the Jackson family.\n\nDespite the announcement, more than two dozen TV satellite trucks lined the narrow two-lane road leading to the ranch.\n\nFor a time, the California Highway Patrol closed the road to clear up a small bottleneck of cars created by Jackson fans and the media.\n\nCNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nNEW: 11,000 memorial service tickets will be made available\n\n@highlight\n\nSource: Jackson memorial to be Tuesday at Los Angeles' Staples Center\n\n@highlight\n\nJackson appears healthy in video clip of rehearsal two days before death\n\n@highlight\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration reportedly joins inquiry into Jackson's death", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3667, "text": "The Drug Enforcement Administration"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who has  joined inquiry into Jackson's death?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 5763, "text": "Neverland Ranch.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where will the memorial take place?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "How many days before Jackson's death was the video taken?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 370, "text": "Staples Center"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where will Jackon's memorial be?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 4190, "text": "look at doctors involved with"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who joins the inquiry into Jackson's death?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 358, "text": "20,000-seat"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many service tickets will be made available?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 138, "text": "11,000"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many memorial service tickets will be made available?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "Michael Jackson's"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Whose memorial will be Tuesday?", "id": "./cnn/stories/512e80a87a428d2ee0ff32b00c98c1f4abdac48f.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/06d8caa4a0f92518d748e2c72bfc4ce6a5e378e3.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Washington (CNN) -- The stars were out Sunday night as the John F.

At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered.\n\nThrough reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Watch Jenny's story »\n\nChastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male.\n\nWhile still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term \"LGBT\" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film \"Boys Don't Cry\" as well as the 2002 book \"Middlesex\" by Jeffrey Eugenides.\n\nMany people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn't understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.\n\n\"I get up every morning and say, 'Wow, I can actually look at myself in the mirror,' because I've never been able to do that in my life, because what would stare back at me was not me,\" Praus said. iReport.com: Share your story of gender change\n\nDoctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. The interactions between personality and culture also contribute to identity, said Chris Kraft, clinical director at the Johns Hopkins Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit.\n\nThe process of changing genders\n\nFor people who want a gender change on a biological level, the first step is therapy, experts say. Dr. Gary Alter, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, said patients don't come to him until they've been in therapy, a process that can take as much as a year.\n\nA therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment. At that point, the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex, Alter said.\n\nFemales seeking to transition into males may elect to have their breasts removed via surgery. With testosterone, they will grow hair on their face and chest after about two years. Read one man's female-to-male advice to Chaz Bono\n\nA higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males, Alter said. Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are \"not perfect,\" and many patients are happy with just chest surgery, he said.\n\nGenital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better, he said. Alter's method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis, and make space for a vagina.\n\nFacing the rest of the world\n\nIt is rare for people to undergo a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved, experts say.\n\nSome say changing genders is one of the best things they've done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of \"Becoming a Visible Man,\" who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery.\n\n\"I don't have too hard of a time telling people about it,\" Green said. \"I worried about that a lot in the beginning, before there was any kind of community and support about this condition, but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy.\"\n\nGreen, who started his transition at age 40, is now happily married to a woman whom he did not know before his change. Praus is also married to a woman, who knew her before her transition. Madden has a boyfriend.\n\n\"For the longest time, I really felt like I had a mental illness, and I don't feel that way anymore,\" Madden said.\n\nBut all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them. Green said his mother took five years to adjust. One of Praus' sons doesn't speak to her. Madden's marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition, and her children have struggled.\n\nYet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles.\n\n\"My patients say I'm a better doctor,\" Praus said. \"Some of it is that I'm not exerting so much energy hiding myself.\"\n\nPsychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a \"transgendered identity,\" and not keep their history of transition a secret. But some who \"pass\" as their new genders don't want to risk stigma, and tell only people closest to them, Kraft said.\n\nOften, males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males, Kraft said.

We are going after CO2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect,\" he told CNN.\n\nWhile the idea of carbon-catchers may sound far-fetched, an early model has been built and Lackner is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nHe personally explained the concept in a 45-minute meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month at a three-day symposium on climate change in London.\n\n\"He was there and I was there and he showed interest,\" Lackner told CNN. \"That's exciting, but I don't particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because I think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the Department of Energy in a way that makes them more palatable.\"\n\nLackner started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998. \"I argued back then and I still argue that the reason this can be done, from a theoretical point of view, is that the CO2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated, therefore the device you need to collect CO2 is quite small.\"\n\nThe \"synthetic tree\" looks more like a public convenience block than a hi-tech method of reducing carbon emissions, but Lackner told CNN it is highly efficient for its size when compared, for example, to a modern power-generating wind turbine.\n\n\"If you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much CO2 can I avoid? And if I had an equally sized CO2 collector -- how much CO2 can I collect? It turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill.\"\n\nIs the \"synthetic tree\" an interesting alternative, or a  scientific flight of fancy that's unlikely to happen? Sound Off below.\n\nLackner told CNN that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the \"front-end\" carbon collector, including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air.\n\nBut after years of research, Lackner told CNN he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is \"close to the ideal,\" in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the CO2 and is not prohibitively expensive.\n\n\"By the time we make liquid CO2 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [of electricity] per mole of CO2.\" Compare that, Lackner said, to the average power plant in the U.S. which produces one mole of CO2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity.\n\n\"In other words, if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs, for every roughly 1000 kilograms [of carbon dioxide] we collected we would re-emit 200, so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful,\" he said.\n\nLackner told CNN the biggest cost was at the \"back-end\" of the collector, primarily the technology used to release the CO2 from the sorbent.\n\nHe said for that reason, on a cost-basis, the \"synthetic tree\" could not compete with modern coal-fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors. But he said when compared to the cost of retro-fitting an existing coal plant, the \"synthetic tree\" becomes more viable.\n\n\"The bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal-fired power plant retro-fit, but not much higher.\"\n\nBesides, he said, the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large-scale use on coal-fired power stations. He's targeting carbon that's already in the air.\n\nThe concept of the \"synethic tree\" has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming, Lackner's colleague at Columbia University, Newberry Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Professor Wally Broecker.\n\n\"I'm extremely excited about this. I think this is something that the world's going to have to have, unfortunately,\" Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he received a BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work on the issue of climate change.\n\nBroecker told CNN most people still don't recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions, and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken, above and beyond the current measures being discussed.\n\n\"We're probably not going to stop CO2 rising until it's double what it was near-1800 and maybe even more than that,\" he said. \"I think we will find that the planet is too warm, ice is melting too fast... and we'll want to bring the CO2 back down again. The only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere.\"\n\nBroecker told CNN the units could stand in the middle of Australia, for example, and their presence wouldn't significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution.\n\n\"Each unit would take out a ton of CO2 a day -- which would be the amount of CO2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the U.S.A. And the cost of each unit would be about the cost of a Toyota. So that would mean if you added a five percent surcharge on automobile purchases that money could go to building units to remove the CO2 those vehicles are going to create.\"\n\n@highlight\n\n\"Synthetic tree\" would capture carbon dioxide in the air to reduce emissions\n\n@highlight\n\nTrapped carbon would be compressed to liquid CO2 ready for sequestration\n\n@highlight\n\nTechnology is being developed by scientists at Columbia University in the U.S.\n\n@highlight\n\nBroecker: \"I think this is something that the world's going to have to have\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 102, "text": "collecting carbon"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What does the tree do?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What does Broecker say about it?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Is synthetic tree reducing emissions?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 113, "text": "carbon"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What would the \"Synthetic tree\" capture?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What would happen to the trapped carbon?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 4811, "text": "his is something that the world's going to have to have, unfortunately,\" Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he recei"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what did Broecker say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 862, "text": "Universi"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What university is working on this technology?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 570, "text": "carbon anytime, anywhere.\\n\\n\"Ha"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What technology will do for human being?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1728, "text": "rking on"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is developing the technology?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7358adf580e448c8fde7e2dae445074aa07c6c31.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced.\n\nSri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday.\n\nTroops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency.\n\n\"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,\" Lt.

The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.\n\nThe rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.\n\nIn recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.\n\nEarlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.\n\nIt had been in rebel hands for more than nine years.\n\nThe re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.\n\n\"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost... about 90 percent of what they had.\"\n\nDespite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict.\n\n\"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire,\" United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday.\n\n\"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he added. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\"\n\nSri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place.\n\nAmnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\"\n\nThe organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict.\n\n\"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.\n\n\"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said.\n\nAt least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.\n\nOthers have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.\n\n@highlight\n\nRebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996, established a military garrison there\n\n@highlight\n\nMilitary making significant progress to recapture rebel strongholds\n\n@highlight\n\nEarlier this month troops regained control of key northern town of Elephant Pass\n\n@highlight\n\nTamils want independent homeland, war since 1983 has left more than 65,000 dead", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1125, "text": "ullai"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When did rebels gain control?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 917, "text": "nown as the T"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who wants independent homeland?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1219, "text": "In recent day"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is making progress?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1110, "text": "control ove"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did rebels gain control over?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 117, "text": "early Sunday morning,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When did they do this?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 852, "text": "ken.\\n\\nThe Liberation Tigers of"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who wants an independent homeland?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 338, "text": "of Mullaitt"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which northern town did troops regain control of?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1148, "text": "established a mili"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did they establish there?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1079, "text": "ople dead.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who gained control?", "id": "./cnn/stories/174cf1e044a2493cc998cbed0c8ea063f560560f.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/2f94b28a4c6adeb0260d2c49f3a91daed63097a6.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and members of the Sex Pistols have led tributes to the band's former manager Malcolm McLaren who died of cancer on Thursday aged 64.\n\nAs manager of the Sex Pistols and owner, with his then-lover Westwood, of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s, McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement.\n\n\"When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm, I thought he was beautiful and I still do,\" Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement.\n\nWestwood's son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren's girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma.\n\n\"I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person.

Her face is smeared with white streaks of powder. And her eyes are blank as she sifts through the debris of what used to be her home before Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar one night and swept her parents away.\n\nHer name is Nway, and that's how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village. She refused to talk about the cyclone, pretending it never took place. She became, according to a CNN story, the \"girl who refuses to remember.\"\n\nA year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing. She found Nway living in a tidy, bamboo house flanked by palm trees. The 8-year-old greeted her visitor with a big smile. Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor's hair.\n\nPam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.\n\n\"After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl,\" said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group. \"She wasn't shy about reaching out to touch my blonde hair.\"\n\nThe night everything changed\n\nNway's resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say.\n\nLast year's cyclone was catastrophic. It killed at least 140,000 people and left at least 2 million people without homes, according to the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\nThe brunt of the storm hit Myanmar's delta region, the country's bread basket. It wiped out crops, shrimp farms and fish ponds. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say.\n\nYet some sense of normal life is returning, said Mia Marina, a program support manager for World Vision's Nargis response efforts. World Vision is building cyclone-resistant schools and providing supplies to cyclone survivors.\n\n\"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods,\" Marina said. \"Kids are going to school. The markets are open.\"\n\nThe people of Myanmar are also buying planting tools and seed in preparation for the monsoon rains that typically come in May, Sitko said.\n\n\"Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around,\" Sitko said. \"It's an exciting time, a time of hope.\"\n\nThat hope appears to have spread to Nway.\n\nShe is fortunate to be alive. The cyclone killed her mother and father. The winds were so powerful that they blew away the village buffalo. In Nway's village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives.\n\nNway survived because she was staying with her aunt. The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman's house to survive, Sitko said.\n\nNway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later. She would walk away whenever she was asked about that night. Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss.\n\nSitko said Nway shared one memory from the morning after the cyclone while sitting in her aunt's house:\n\n\"When I walked to my aunt's house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies,\" Nway said. \"I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie's yard.\"\n\nNway dreams of her future\n\nNway prefers to talk about other subjects. One is her new job. She helps her aunt sell vegetables from their garden. On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it's used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar). Then she balances a tray of vegetables on her head and walks to a village road to call out to potential customers.\n\nNway told Sitko that she's made \"four new best friends.\" They like to memorize new words and play hide and seek after school.\n\n\"I'm always the fastest runner,\" she told Sitko.\n\nNway is starting to become aware of life outside her village.\n\n\"She was very proud,\" Sitko said. \"She explained that she had recently taken a trip to another village with her aunties, and she wasn't afraid.\"\n\nNway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. She'll have to pay to attend school away from her village one day, but her aunt and uncle can't afford the costs.\n\n\"She wanted to study and said that she was smart,\" Sitko said. \"She said she would be willing to travel to a school outside of her village if she had to.\"\n\nNway has already taken a more difficult journey.\n\nThe shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said. Now Nway can remember -- and smile again.\n\n\"I was expecting a very different girl,\" Sitko said. \"The little girl I met was very confident. I think she's been really transformed by our experience.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nGirl who survives Myanmar cyclone pretends it never happened\n\n@highlight\n\nCyclone survivor becomes known as 'the girl who refuses to remember'\n\n@highlight\n\nAid worker returns to Myanmar a year later to see the girl\n\n@highlight\n\n\"I was expecting a very different girl,\" worker says", "qas": [{"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "what did the survivor come to be known as?", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 452, "text": "Nway,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who survived the cyclone?", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2786, "text": "Nway survived"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "were there any survivors", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 718, "text": "an aid worker"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who came back a year later?", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 363, "text": "Cyclone Nargis"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what did the girl survive?", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 971, "text": "Pam Sitko,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "who was the aid worker", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 391, "text": "Myanmar"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "where was the cyclone", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 905, "text": "Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor's hair.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what did the worker say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/09219dd44d20f76a3d09330ee3a38d8566a32b64.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9aa6463127d1efcba4403a185b29849a3688db8d.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Police have arrested a man in the killing of Auburn University freshman Lauren Burk, who died this week, according to the Auburn, Alabama, assistant police chief.\n\nCourtney Larrell Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, is charged with capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery, and capital murder during an attempted rape, Tommy Dawson said Saturday.\n\nThe Phenix City Police Department took Lockhart into custody on Friday, police said.

Police want to investigate every possible lead, Dawson said.\n\nAuthorities were still on patrol in the east Alabama campus, he said.\n\nThe university's Web site said a campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday.\n\nThe site carried a message from Burk's father, James, which said: \"The Burk family was so proud to have Lauren as an Auburn University student.

William Pelletier.\n\nAfter the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said.\n\nUnsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said.\n\nThe released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said.\n\nFinally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said. Then, another group of women came out, covered from head to toe according to custom, he said, with a couple of children in tow. The Marines attended to the wounded woman while the others walked away.\n\nWhen the Marines went into the compound, they discovered that it empty, Pelletier said. That's when they realized the fighters had dressed up as women to escape, he said.\n\n\"Apparently these were tall, rather broad-shouldered women with hairy feet,\" Pelletier said.\n\nThe Marines' restrained approach differs from previous hits on compounds when airstrikes were readily called in, the official said.\n\nUnder a new tactical directive for forces in Afghanistan, some of which was unclassified Monday, forces must protect civilians soldiers and must be sensitive to Afghan cultural norms regarding women.\n\nPelletier said that during the standoff, \"the Marines didn't have any female forces to do any searches, and they weren't going to violate cultural norms by patting down these women.\"\n\nThe standoff in the town of Khan Neshin was especially significant because it has been a Taliban stronghold for several years, and the U.S. military reported that the Afghan government regained control of the town Monday.\n\nCoalition forces began talks with local leaders several days ago and have moved about 500 Marines into Khan Neshin, a U.S. military news release said.

It's been this way since the carrier debuted its LTE network in late 2010.\n\nBut now that AT&T has joined the LTE game, consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to AT&T instead.\n\nIf only for a while.\n\nMetrico Wireless, a firm that does network and mobile device analytics, took a look at 4G LTE service in the U.S., focusing on two of the nation's largest carriers, Verizon and AT&T.\n\nThe company's latest report shows that AT&T's average LTE speeds are better than Verizon's (for now at least), and that LTE provides more than five times the performance of the carriers' respective 3G offerings.\n\nMetrico used five 4G LTE handsets for its tests: two on AT&T, three on Verizon. On AT&T, the HTC Vivid and Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket were measured. The HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Droid Charge and Motorola Droid Bionic were tested on Verizon's network.\n\nIn stationary download speeds, AT&T's 4G LTE handsets outperformed those on Verizon, but Metrico believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that Verizon's LTE service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it.\n\nIndeed, as of April, Verizon had over half a million LTE subscribers. AT&T, meanwhile, just launched its LTE network in five markets this summer.\n\nBut while AT&T's data speeds were better, web pages actually loaded faster on the three Verizon smartphones tested. \"In general, the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device, but by the combination of the two,\" the report states.\n\n\"Even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance.\"\n\nThis was especially true with regards to video performance. Of the smartphones tested, the Samsung Droid Charge (on Verizon) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate, while the Motorola Droid Bionic (also on Verizon) had the lowest.\n\nAlso, if you're really concerned about web page load times, consider this: All carrier-to-carrier comparisons notwithstanding, both AT&T and Verizon handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on LTE relative to 3G.\n\nWhat about battery life on an LTE device, notoriously reported as being poor? Well, depending on how you use your device, you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours, as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use.\n\nOn the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket, you're going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device, whether you're a power user or someone who's making calls all day long.\n\nOn the Verizon Droid Bionic, though, those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nVerizon's LTE network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage, but AT&T's is set to rival it as it expands.\n\nAnd, indeed, we're finally beginning to see LTE infrastructure build-outs, industry-wide. Joining Metro PCS, Verizon and AT&T in the LTE game is Cricket Wireless, perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options.\n\nCricket will offer speeds up to 6 Mbps with a 5 GB data cap.

Taliban militants in the wake of a deadly mosque attack last week.\n\nA Pakistani police stands guard at a checkpoint in Peshawar, Pakistan on June 8.\n\nIt is the first major battle between the residents of northwest Pakistan and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan border.\n\nThe residents are outraged over a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers that killed at least 40 people and wounded some 80 others.\n\nStarting on Saturday morning, some 400 villagers in the Upper Dir district formed a \"lashkar\" -- or militia -- to fight the Taliban, killing 14 of the militants

If it does, we can begin to feel that we are moving in the right direction, but if it doesn't -- well, no one is quite sure what Plan D looks like. Is this really where we have come: that the fate of our precious coastlines and the waters off our coasts are in the hands of a single foreign-based company?\n\nA month ago, it looked like the White House was on top of this problem, as Cabinet officers scurried here and there, the Coast Guard and others swung into action, there were talks with BP, and the president paid a personal visit. But increasingly, it has become apparent that the federal government may be present but is not in charge.\n\nIt keeps saying that BP bears ultimate responsibility. It is keeping the press away. No wonder James Carville, Chris Matthews and Donna Brazile exploded late last week. They are right on a basic point: Ultimately it is not the responsibility of BP or any other company to protect American interests but the responsibility of the federal government. Some Obama supporters have argued that the 1990 Oil Pollution Act limits the president's capacity to take action. Others disagree. Either way, in an emergency, laws can be changed.\n\nAlthough this disaster is not an existential threat, it could be argued that if the U.S. government had fought World War II in the same way it has fought the oil spill, we might well be speaking German now. Faced with a growing danger to our well-being, a WWII-type government would at minimum have:\n\n• Brought in the CEOs of all the major oil companies and charged them with the duty of an all-hands collaborative effort to stop the spill and help ward off the damage.\n\n• Brought in the best minds in the country, from universities and technology, for emergency efforts to find solutions.\n\n• Moved quickly to mobilize the National Guard and other military forces, if necessary, ensuring that they received the resources needed to protect our beaches.\n\n• Made a clear call to citizen volunteers to help where necessary.\n\n• Given Cabinet officers an ultimatum: Get this under control in the next 30 days, or else.\n\nThere will be ample time after this disaster for finger-pointing and blame-laying. The key now is to get this spill under control before it does far more damage.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post had it exactly right Monday morning when it argued that with the European crisis spreading now beyond Greece, \"the knife-edge psychology currently governing global markets has put the future of the U.S. economic recovery in the hands of politicians in an assortment of European capitals.\"\n\nAcross Europe, one finds people stunned at the rapidity with which this crisis has grown, threatening not only their weak economies but also their dreams of a European utopia with people living a honeyed existence. All that could go smash now. Indeed, it is ironic that Europe may now be forced to give up its strong welfare state even as the U.S. is moving toward it. But the immediate point is that the U.S. finds itself too much at the mercy of whether European politicians and publics now make the right moves.\n\nIt may take a while, but Americans are going to start feeling a lot happier about our country when we once again believe we have strong control of own destiny.

Slack created the male-friendly portion while Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day and the Wedded Bliss Foundation, created the female-friendly portion.\n\nIn the program, couples also learn about the history of the African-American marriage and many for the first time plot their own family tree to trace marriage and divorces.  The following is rundown of the eight-week course:  Class No. 1: Why marriage?\n\nThis class teaches the benefits of marriage for men, women, children and the community. It gives the history of marriage in the black community from slavery when marriage was illegal to today's trends.\n\nIcebreaker: Q & A: How couples met?\n\nHomework:\n\n1. Choose songs to reflect their love for each other\n\n2. Marriage family tree\n\nClass No. 2: From I to we; the sweetness of surrender\n\nThis class helps couples transition from \"I thinking\" to \"we thinking.\" It helps them understand the value of making their marriage a priority in their lives.\n\nClass No. 3: Communication; getting your message understood\n\nThis class helps couples take responsibility for their communication and teaches skills to improve their communication techniques.\n\nMain lessons:\n\n• Respecting differences between men and women\n\n• Learning to talk to each other and not at each other\n\n• Format: Teaching session with dialogue.\n\n• Activity: The talking stick, during conversation only the individual holding the stick can speak.\n\nClass No. 4: Conflict management\n\nThis class helps couples understand that conflict needs to be managed, or it will manage you. It helps to normalize some conflict that couples experience with the understanding that some conflict cannot be resolved and can only be managed.\n\nLessons:\n\n• This class targets biases. When there's a difference of opinions, generally the stronger spouse wants his or her way.\n\n• How to bring closure to old issues instead of combining them into new issues/conflict.\n\n• Agree to disagree and not degrade your spouse for having a difference of opinion.\n\nActivity: Break up into gender groups to discuss current conflicts. The group works out ways to solve the issue\n\nClass No. 5: Let's make love\n\nWhen the sex is good in a marriage, it's only about 20 percent of what's going on. When it's bad, it's a significant problem. This class helps to solve some of those problems.\n\nThe approach was from a physiological and biological perspective of the differences between the male's and female's body. Discussion included chemical bonding effect in women and men.\n\nClass No. 6: From yours and mine to ours\n\nMany couples in the black community bring children from other relationships to their marriage. This class helps to blend the family into one cohesive unit. It also talks about preventing in-laws from becoming outlaws.\n\nClass No. 7: Keeping the FIRE burning\n\nFIRE is an acronym for Faithful, Intimacy, Responsibility and Excitement. This class helps couples maintain the FIRE in their relationship.\n\nClass No. 8: From this day forward\n\nThis class helps couples understand the value of commitment in their marriage and never to make divorce an option. They create their own place for success.\n\nRecap of all the lessons together:\n\n• Remembering people gravitate to the applause • Ways to appreciate and affirm your spouse • Setting time for just the two of you • Learning to communicate, getting your message heard and understood\n\nBonus class: Hot monogamy\n\nGets couples comfortable to discuss sex with their spouse.\n\nGraduation\n\nA ceremony of new beginnings, couples testify what the class brought to their marriage over the eight-week period. Lots of emotions and bonding during this time between husbands and wives.\n\nGraduating couples are encouraged to bring a couple from their community or family who needs help.\n\n@highlight\n\nNisa Muhammad and Rozario Slack created a Basic Training for Couples\n\n@highlight\n\nThe eight-week program helps dating, engaged and married couples stay on track\n\n@highlight\n\nUnhealthy relationships give kids inaccurate views of marriage, says Muhammad", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 219, "text": "Basic Training for Couples program.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "where is it held?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7018e29f808ad4f2a83ece085cb831e6f1cb1be8.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What are the consequences of unhealthy relationships where children are concerned?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7018e29f808ad4f2a83ece085cb831e6f1cb1be8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 262, "text": "eight-week"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many weeks is the program?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7018e29f808ad4f2a83ece085cb831e6f1cb1be8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 262, "text": "eight-week"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How long is the program?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7018e29f808ad4f2a83ece085cb831e6f1cb1be8.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 57, "text": "Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who created a program for couples?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7018e29f808ad4f2a83ece085cb831e6f1cb1be8.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What is the program for?", "id": "./cnn/stories/7018e29f808ad4f2a83ece085cb831e6f1cb1be8.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bad69c9a3c7d84a4717705a3063dd7367243772b.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Panama City Beach, Florida, police are looking for a hotel security guard accused of raping an Alabama student and throwing her off a sixth-floor hotel balcony, a police spokesman told CNN.\n\nPolice released this photo of Shawn Wuertly, who worked as a hotel security guard in Panama City Beach, Florida.\n\nThe 18-year-old woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, remains hospitalized, but her injuries are not life-threatening, Lt.

The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina's once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency.\n\nArgentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle.\n\nCow carcasses litter the prairie fields and sun-scorched soy plants wither under the South American summer sun. Farmers are concerned about their livelihoods.\n\n\"I'm losing money. I can't afford to lose money all the time,\" said Juan Cahen D'Anvers, whose family has been farming in Argentina since the late 1700s. He owns 700 hectares (1,730 acres) in San Miguel del Monte, where he grows sunflowers and barley.\n\nHe says this year is one of the hardest he's ever had.  Watch farmer explain how hard he's been hit »\n\n\"Production is going to go down a minimum of 50 percent, maybe more. I don't know yet,\" he said.\n\nArgentina is one of the world's breadbaskets, providing commodities such as soy, wheat, corn and beef to countries around the globe. In recent years, record-high prices for these products reaped millions of dollars for Argentine farmers, but since the global economic crisis hit, demand and profits have dropped. Now the drought is making matters even worse.\n\nCesar Gioia, another San Miguel del Monte farmer, said time is growing short.\n\n\"If it doesn't rain in the next 10 days, I will have to wipe out my entire corn crop, 90 hectares (220 acres),\" he said. \"The best I can do with it is feed it to my cows.\"\n\nFacing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year.\n\n\"This is a big boost of patriotism, and a sign of support from all Argentines,\" Kirchner said on January 26. \"All other sectors of the economy will continue to contribute, so we can help the farmers who have been affected by this drought.\"\n\nKirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. Those taxes eventually were reduced, but farming leaders still contend that the government is out of touch with their needs.\n\nThey say the measures announced this week fall short, and are demanding a cohesive, long-term plan for dealing with emergencies such as the current drought. If not, they say, they may strike again.  Watch how farmers reacted to Kirchner's move »\n\n\"Sure, this plan is approved now, and it helps, but we need money to feed cows, to go back to planting crops, because this drought is impacting life in every sector of society,\" said Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation.\n\nAs she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina's world-famous beef.\n\n\"We will see less meat available, which means rising prices,\" she said. \"There is even the possibility that in a few years Argentina will have to import beef, which is almost unthinkable for people here.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nWorst drought in 50 years is hitting Argentina\n\n@highlight\n\nFarmers say they are losing 50 percent or more of crops\n\n@highlight\n\nCow carcasses litter the landscape while plants wither in the summer sun", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 736, "text": "ina since"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where is the drought hitting?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f5ecbbb7d41f75f3a9409b36f3972ed65b8adec0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 450, "text": "carcasses litt"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What litters the plants?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f5ecbbb7d41f75f3a9409b36f3972ed65b8adec0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 209, "text": "half a century"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How long has it been since the last drought this severe?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f5ecbbb7d41f75f3a9409b36f3972ed65b8adec0.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 104, "text": "Buenos Aires,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did the drought hit?", "id": "./cnn/stories/f5ecbbb7d41f75f3a9409b36f3972ed65b8adec0.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e620ed92abb263c485bab0bbd64b349e6317c938.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy \"The Proposal\" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride?

Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s?\n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual.\n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is \"X-Men's\" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.)\n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.)\n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue.\n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.\n\nReynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks.\n\nWho knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. iReport.com: \"Proposal\" has \"plenty of laughs\"\n\nSomething borrowed: The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from \"The Office\"). The snappy screwball dialogue in Pete Chiarelli's script.

I find it more convenient than my regular TV...,\" Michael Heard, a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta, Georgia, said via e-mail. \"I'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another.\n\n\"And also my time is important, so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. isn't convenient. Online TV allows me to watch what I want when I want.\"\n\nNetworks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach Web-watching audiences by streaming content on their Web sites or making partnerships with Hulu, one of the larger online TV sites.\n\nNow, Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content. It is available to all Comcast customers, so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service.\n\nHeard said he doesn't expect to give up Hulu, though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast.\n\nHeard, trying out the site Tuesday after it went live, tweeted that he thought the service was \"awesome,\" and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of \"The Sopranos.\"\n\n\"The quality, it's really clear and loads fast,\" he said, though he noted there were still some bugs in the product.\n\nHeard occasionally had to reload the site, and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu.\n\nThe service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter, with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences.\n\nSome complained that high-definition videos, which are available on Hulu, are not available on Comcast's service. Others complained about having to download a separate video player, the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system, and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers.\n\nComcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future. In the next six months, after the service has gone through more beta testing, the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base.\n\nCustomers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to. Those not paying for HBO regularly, for example, won't be able to snag the newest episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" online.\n\nIn addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker, Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar. Executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months.\n\nTo access the content, users simply need to log in with their Comcast e-mail address at fancast.com.

Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.

You won't let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right.\"\n\nErdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as \"barbaric\" and accused Israel of using excessive force.\n\nHe said: \"The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism.\"\n\nPeres had said Hamas was responsible for the \"tragedy,\" accusing the Islamist militants of creating a \"dangerous dictatorship.\"\n\n\"Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation,\" Peres said. \"I want to understand why they throw rockets at us.\"\n\nOn Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero's welcome. Thousands of people lined up at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, cheering and waving signs. A large banner read, \"You Will Never Walk Alone,\" and smaller signs bore phrases including \"Davos Conqueror.\" People also were seen waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and throwing flowers on the road leading to Erdogan's home.\n\nDespite the glowing response at the airport, there has been some criticism in the Turkish media of Erdogan's exchange with the Israeli president.\n\nCNN Turk's Deniz Bayramoglu said the issue was still \"hot\" with Erdogan's secularist political opponents speaking out against the prime minister.\n\n\"They also say that Israel's behavior in Gaza is unacceptable but they are very critical of Prime Minister Erdogan's behavior,\" Bayramoglu said.\n\n\"Some are saying they are really proud of Prime Minister Erdogan and some are saying it is a diplomatic scandal.\"\n\nErdogan explained whom he was directing his anger at during a news conference at the airport. \"My words were only to the Israeli government, not the Israeli people,\" he said.\n\nCNN's Simon Hooper and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nTurkish Prime Minister angered during debate on Gaza at World Economic Forum\n\n@highlight\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan called Israel's Gaza campaign \"barbaric,\" stormed off stage\n\n@highlight\n\nIsraeli president Shimon Peres said he and Erdogan did not take spat personally\n\n@highlight\n\nErdogan returned home to a hero's welcome in Istanbul", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 891, "text": "flict »\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What country is Istanbul in?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 338, "text": "t Shimon Pere"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is the Israeli president?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What did the Israeli president say about the spat?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2200, "text": "This is"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who called Israel's Gaza campaign barbaric?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2301, "text": "\"barba"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Erdogan called what country's campaign barbaric?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2278, "text": "mas fighter"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did Recep Tayyip Erdogan call the Gaza campaign?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1230, "text": "nAnd in"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who was angered during the debate on Gaza?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 320, "text": "s Israeli Presiden"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is Shimon Peres?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 382, "text": "and Erdogan did not take the spat personal"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Peres said he and Erdrogan didn't what?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2883, "text": "Thousands of people lined up"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did Erdogan go for a hero's welcome?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 237, "text": "Davos, Switzerland.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where was the World Economic Forum held?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1020, "text": "egion,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "The prime minister of what country was angered?", "id": "./cnn/stories/eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b7f38f54c4073c6c1955c815ca146c4e04a47da5.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Arsenal climbed to the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham despite playing half of Saturday's clash with only 10 men.\n\nArsene Wenger's team moved a point above champions Manchester United, who host Liverpool on Sunday, while Chelsea dropped to third ahead of their trip to Blackburn.

appearing to be offside, and the Norway striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered Steve Sidwell's low shot into the visitors' net for his 13th league goal this season.\n\nWolves moved four points clear of the bottom three, but were denied a first win at Villa Park in 30 years despite Jody Craddock's bundled 23rd-minute equalizer and an own-goal from England international James Milner seven minutes before halftime.\n\nThe result left Villa in seventh, having played one less game than Tottenham, equal on 50 points with Manchester City, who travel to Fulham

After some contract negotiation, it became Scott and I.\"\n\nLongtime fans of the legendary Canadian sketch comedy group know the full cast as also including Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney. (McDonald didn't specify which of these three was asked to be half a man on the tour, but the smart money is on Foley.)\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success, and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore. For instance, if you've ever crushed somebody's head, you, sir, have enjoyed a Kids in the Hall moment.\n\nThere's plenty more from their catalog of absurdity, and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the Interwebs. But if you're looking for a place to start, this author's personal favorite is a sketch called \"Citizen Kane.\" And my friend Paul favors one called \"Wrong Number.\" So, here, now, you have some Kids in the Hall advice from somebody named Paul, and somebody with the last name Bellini.\n\nFeel free to touch us.\n\nDespite being known for their sketches, the current Scott Thompson/Kevin McDonald tour is actually more focused on stand-up comedy. Thompson says, \"I never liked it until very recently. I always felt too exposed and out of control.\"\n\nIt's definitely something new for Thompson and McDonald, and, perhaps, even more new for their fans. But the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show. And it certainly came out when we sat down with them in Atlanta before their performances at The Punchline. As you'll see in our video, Thompson and McDonald feed off each other with ease, often completing each other's thoughts.\n\nCertainly, like all comedy, the Kids in the Hall aren't for everyone, but there's no denying their success; especially if catching the eye of a young Uma Thurman is the barometer of that success.\n\nThompson recalls meeting her backstage after a show early in the group's career.\n\n\"Uma Thurman at the time was the sexiest woman in the world,\" he says. \"We had never met a celebrity before. We all thought she wanted to sleep with us. It really was a big launching pad for us. It made us think that wow, we're in the big leagues. She was the first responder.\"\n\nShe didn't sleep with them.\n\n@highlight\n\nMcDonald and Thompson were part of the Kids in the Hall sketch comedy group\n\n@highlight\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success and pop culture fame\n\n@highlight\n\nDespite being known for sketches, the current tour is stand-up comedy", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1474, "text": "n stand-up comedy.

It was a tough five months,\" Kevin's father, Heiko, told CNN affiliate WSET, from the family home in Lynchburg, Virginia. \"I'm just so happy.\"\n\nHeiko Lunsmann said the boy had plotted his escape for a while and eventually seized the opportunity some time late last week while his guards slept.\n\nHe \"was spotted alone\" Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, the official Philippines News Agency said.\n\nArmy officials turned him over to American forces in the southern Mindanao region, the Philippine government said in a statement to CNN affiliate TV 5.\n\nThe Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor, Roderick Furigay, as saying Kevin walked for two days, surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees.\n\n\"In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations,\" Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement.\n\n\"If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal,\" Thomas added.\n\nFourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan.\n\nKevin's mother was released by her captors in October. Jakaria was released last month, according to the news agency.\n\nBasilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants.\n\nAbu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.\n\nBasilan's governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family, according to the news agency.\n\n\"The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings,\" the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying.\n\nThomas, the U.S. ambassador, said the crime will not go \"unpunished.\"\n\nGerfa Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia.

And it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at Hollywood's big event.\n\n\"La Vie En Rose\" amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the French Cesar Awards. Marion Cotillard's astonishing transformation into Edith Piaf won her Best Actress gongs at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and the Academy Awards. But \"La Vie En Rose\" was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\nAnother French language film, \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,\" was on many critics' top ten lists for the films of 2007. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. But like \"La Vie En Rose,\" this film was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\nA third French film, \"Persepolis\" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film.\n\nFrance suffered through an abundance of riches this year, with three potential Oscar winners. But to enter the race for Best Foreign film, France, like every other country, had to nominate just one.\n\nSo \"La Vie En Rose\" and \"Diving Bell\" were rejected by the French film authorities in favor of \"Persepolis.\" But \"Persepolis\" didn't sufficiently impress the Oscar judges: so France had no films among the final five nominees.\n\nFrench frustration at the Oscar process was echoed in Taiwan, which chose Ang Lee's film, \"Lust Caution,\" as its official entry. The film won both critical acclaim and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan. The double Oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and Taiwan was told to pick another film instead: Oscar caution triumphing over Ang Lee's lust for a third Academy Award.\n\nAnd the list goes on: the Israeli film, \"The Band's Visit\" was excluded for having too much English -- but it's the only way the Israeli and Egyptian protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot. But Israel submitted \"Beaufort\" instead -- and made the final five.\n\n\"The Kite Runner\" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn't fly with Oscar watchdogs. Set in Afghanistan with Farsi as its main language, it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little Afghan involvement and a Swiss-American director.\n\nBut for most critics, the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was Romania's \"4 Months, 3 weeks & 2 Days,\" winner of the Palme D'Or in Cannes and considered by many to be a sure-fire Oscar winner. Some feel its challenging subject of a back-street abortion in communist Romania was too testing for conservative members of the Academy's Foreign Film Committee, whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films?\n\nEven Marc Johnson, the Chairman of the Academy's Foreign Language Film Committee, acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the Academy this year was \"justifiable\".\n\nHe told CNN: \"We took quite a beating, and I think quite justifiably, not for the films that we selected but for the films that we DIDN'T select.\n\n\"And I felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than I should have done, but there was a part of me saying \"wait a minute I didn't sign on for this -- I didn't sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it's something I feel so passionately about I think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the U.S. are really an endangered species.\"\n\nDefenders of the Academy also point out that they're only asking countries to nominate their favorite film; they then pick the best of that bunch.\n\nMr Johnson said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become \"unmanageable\".\n\n\"There have been arguments that why can't a coutnry submit more films? France for instance might argue we make 50 films a year, maybe five of them are Oscar worthy and Ecuador maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they?\" .\n\n\"Not that I ever like to mix sports with the arts but it's a little bit like the World Cup. Brazil could probably submit five teams but they're only allowed to submit one -- and it's what makes it a fair race,\" he explains.\n\n\"The other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films. We could not see many more than that. So if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable.\"\n\nAnd while the one-film-per-country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry, it does ensure diversity: no less than 63 countries from Azerbaijan to Vietnam submitted films for the 80th Academy Awards.\n\nIsrael, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works.

The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said.\n\nThough authorities now believe Wiles was killed, they don't know where his body is, he said.\n\nThe arrest was uneventful, Couvertier said: \"Holt was advised of his rights and said nothing.\"\n\nA four-count grand jury indictment was unsealed Friday in Polk County, where Wiles, then 26, ran a branch of his family's international aircraft maintenance business, National Flight Service, at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport.\n\nThe FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared. He was among several employees who told investigators they last saw Wiles on April 1, 2008, at the office and had no clue what happened to him.\n\nThe FBI won't reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared.\n\nAt the time, agents said Wiles' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing.\n\nHolt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company.\n\nAuthorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida.\n\nWiles was single. When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned.\n\n\"All that he ever worked on was customer relations. Making things better for the company,\" co-worker Jerry Grief said at the time. \"Make the customer happy and make them come back.\"\n\nThe FBI said it traveled to six countries and three states tracing Wiles' trips and interviewing business associates. Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared.\n\nSeveral agencies, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Polk County Sheriff's Department joined the investigation.

He would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days, and then, when he tired of the same tastes, he moved onto something else.\n\nIn August, when summer's heat seemed unending in Mustang, Oklahoma, Beach took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft, sweet cantaloupe.\n\nBeach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit, his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong, he was dead.\n\nHe is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998.\n\nGallery: The decade's 10 biggest food-borne illness outbreaks\n\nThe bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday, the outbreak had affected people in 19 states.\n\nThe CDC first reported it publicly on September 12, six days after William Beach's family buried him.\n\nListeria? What's that?\n\nBeach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery, where the store motto says: \"the best is fresh.\"\n\nA week after he ate the fruit, Beach felt malaise, perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years. But then his face turned the shade of a tomato. Soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms.\n\nMonette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor.\n\nShe hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak, unable to get up.\n\nShe dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked Beach to Baptist Hospital in nearby Oklahoma City. He was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home, he returned to the hospital.\n\nOne of Beach's six daughters, Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room. Beach told her he didn't want Monette to see him this way.\n\nListeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems.\n\nOn the evening of September 1, medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose, the court documents said. Soon after, he died.\n\nMonette never saw her husband alive again. Two days after his funeral, an official from the Oklahoma State Department of Health called Hathaway.\n\nShe was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria.\n\nHathaway's sister Debbie Frederick said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father's body. They had assumed he died of natural causes.\n\n\"We knew it was some sort of infection, but we did not know what it was,\" she said.\n\nBut Listeria? She had never even heard that word before.\n\nWhat you need to know about Listeria\n\nHealth officials began questioning Beach's daughters. What had he eaten in the weeks prior? They specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes.\n\nFrederick, meanwhile, glued herself to her computer, determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father.\n\n\"Doing all that reading, it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue,\" she said. \"They knew there was a Listeria problem.\"\n\nThe Beach family's angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws.\n\n\"It's a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented,\" she said. \"I pray that it's over. I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one.\"\n\nBattling the bacteria\n\nIn Littleton, Colorado, Jeni Exley's parents, Herbert and Elaine Stevens, were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8.\n\nThey still had a good life together. Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood. He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch.\n\nHow to keep your food safe\n\nIn early August, Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe. She didn't buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them. Besides, she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough.\n\nShe and Herbert both ate the lush fruit. Herbert started to feel sick, just like William Beach.\n\nFour days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama, Stevens couldn't get up from the toilet in Colorado. He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous.\n\nElaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital. Unlike the Beach family, Stevens' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria.\n\nExley, 55, like Frederick, went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father. Health officials, after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks, determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak.\n\nAfter antibiotic therapy, Stevens was transferred to a nursing home. Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand. But her father wasn't feeling well. He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened.\n\nStevens eventually regained some of his strength. He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19, the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms' Rocky Ford cantaloupes.\n\nStevens' Listeria is gone but at that age, he will probably never return to the man he was, Exley said.

Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal.\n\nThe White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation.\n\nPrograms that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a Senate filibuster. Democrats would only need 51 votes, not 60, to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation.\n\nReconciliation was created through the Budget Reform Act of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process, strengthen the ability of Congress to make tough decisions regarding deficits, and to make legislative decision-making more efficient.\n\nCongress quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986, when the Senate passed rules proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd that limited what could or could not be included when using this process.\n\nBefore moving forward, Democrats must consider two questions. The first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process. Republicans have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise.\n\nOn this question, the answer is easy. Reconciliation has been as much a part of the Senate in the past three decades as the filibuster. According to an article that was published in The New Republic, Congress passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008. Many important policy changes were enacted through this process, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, COBRA (which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care), student aid reform, expansions in Medicaid and several major tax cuts.\n\nNPR's Julie Rovner reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation. President Ronald Reagan was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said then that speed had been essential because \"Every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass. This is an extraordinary proposal, and these are extraordinary times.\"\n\nPresidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all used reconciliation as well. It is worth noting that these presidents, particularly George W. Bush, also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent Congress altogether.\n\nThe second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions. If the Democratic leadership wants to use this tactic, they have to convince enough members of their own party that this won't scare off independent voters. This argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010. But after a year of dealing with paralysis in the Senate and highly effective Republican obstruction, more Democrats are coming on board.\n\nThe leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation. They will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history.\n\nThey will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the Senate into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major legislation.On this point, Republicans and Democrats actually agree.\n\nIndeed, as Democrats make this decision, Kentucky Republican Senator Jim Bunning is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single-handedly preventing the Senate from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers.\n\nDemocrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost. While, in the short-term, Republicans will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move, Democrats are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway.\n\nRight now, Democrats are receiving the brunt of Republican attacks without being able to pass much legislation. If they pass health care, they will be able to respond to the arguments of the GOP, not just by complaining that Republicans obstruct everything, but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of Americans into the health care system.\n\nIn certain respects, the White House made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the Senate. After the election of Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process.\n\nBut in other respects, the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation. After a year, the public has seen just how dysfunctional Senate procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common.\n\nWith a public that is frustrated by Washington, as the polls show, the Democrats might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along. If they don't, one thing is for certain: Democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E.

A Bhutto spokesman says the opposition leader was rushed away from the scene and was safe.\n\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrives at a campaign rally Thursday in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.\n\n• Pakistan's Geo Television Network, quoting Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, reports the ex-premier was critically wounded in the bombing.\n\n• Former Pakistani government spokesman Tariq Azim Khan says Bhutto was hurt leaving the rally, but there is no indication whether she was shot or hurt in the bombing. Reports from police and the Bhutto camp conflict over whether she was injured.\n\n• Geo TV quotes Zardari saying his wife suffered a bullet wound to the neck after the suicide bombing.\n\n• Khan and Pakistan's primary television networks report Bhutto is dead. Television reports indicate she died of bullet wounds suffered after the suicide bombing.\n\n• Khan says it appears Bhutto was shot, but he adds it's unclear whether bullets or shrapnel caused her wounds.\n\n• Doctors and a spokesman for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party confirm the ex-premier's death, but it remains unclear how she was killed.\n\n• Police tell CNN that a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle detonated himself near Bhutto's motorcade.

Khan says it's unclear if a bullet or shrapnel dealt the fatal wounds.\n\nFriday morning, Pakistan time:\n\n• The Pakistani Interior Ministry tells the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan that Bhutto died of a gunshot wound to the neck. The suicide bomber fired shots before blowing himself up, the ministry tells the news agency.

Burkett seemed boorish, sure. But that doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year: Vote for the future, or make up for the past.\n\nYears from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that \"Avatar,\" one of the biggest movies ever -- and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going -- didn't win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it.\n\nInstead, the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize.\n\nWhat helped make it all so complicated was not that there's been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for.\n\nThe sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct.\n\nPredictably, Bigelow didn't have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. And she was.\n\nBut earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things. Fortunately for Bigelow, she had history on her side last night.\n\nJames Cameron didn't.\n\nThe billions being made by \"Avatar\" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the Academy voters like.\n\nIn fact, the big-hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges (\"Crazy Heart\"), and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock (\"The Blind Side\"), are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be.\n\nThat, and a few good jokes, which is what Martin and Baldwin provided, arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989.\n\nLooking back on Oscar's 'train wreck'\n\nNothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night, although there were a few moments of bad choices, bad manners and a strategy that was, at best, elusive.\n\nFor all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what: one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight (ET) no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque.\n\nLast night did not disappoint. While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra (after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for \"The New Tenants\"), the show's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, unspeakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evening's musical scores.\n\nMore painful, at least to this viewer's eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald, for instance, and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked.\n\nThe only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category: The Argentine \"El Secreto de Sus Ojos,\" beat out the favored \"White Ribbon,\" thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen (a foreign-film Oscar doesn't do much good, one should remember, for a movie that's already opened and closed).\n\nThe other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her \"Young Victoria\" Oscar.\n\n\"I've already got two of these,\" she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the Academy in toto.\n\nBrusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it's not likely Ms. Powell will be back, unlike Martin and Baldwin, who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever, proving there's power in numbers, the sum often can be more than the parts, and that it's always good to have an extra pair of hands, as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow's butt.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson.\n\n@highlight\n\nOscar had to atone for history of overlooked

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- It was supposed to be just another day at work.\n\nJob losses suffered by Linda and Chris Metzger have had a ripple effect on other businesses in their community\n\nIn early March 2008, 31-year-old Linda Metzger went to the New York office where she had worked as an assistant vice president in the marketing department at Lehman Brothers for about a year. Only 15 minutes into her work day, Metzger was called into her manager's office, where a representative from human resources was waiting.\n\n\"They told me that the company was having economic difficulties and that they had to make budget cuts,\" Metzger said. \"They were afraid that they were going to have to let me go and that it was not due to performance.\"\n\nMetzger says that would be her last day at Lehman Brothers. She was given some time to collect her composure, gather her belongings and head home.\n\nShe was out of a $90,000-a-year job and was getting married in three months. Metzger says it was a chance for her and her fiancé to refocus, relocate and start a new life.\n\nWithin a few weeks, they both found jobs near Phoenix, Arizona, earning close to what they were making in New York. They bought a home and two new cars and got married.\n\nBut the good feelings suddenly and dramatically ended in October when Metzger, who was four months pregnant, showed up to work at Lumension, where she was a marketing manager.\n\nMetzger says she was called into the office, and it happened again. She was laid off from her second job in less than a year.  Watch Linda talk about getting laid off »\n\n\"I was so overwhelmed and so shocked that I just immediately burst into tears.\"\n\nShe thought about how she and her new husband, who had just moved across the country, were going to be able to afford their new life and all the bills that came with it.\n\nA week later, Chris Metzger was called into his manager's office at the job placement agency where he worked. He was told that because of the economy, his office was closing, and he was out of a job. Now he had to break the news to his wife.\n\n\"I just came home, and she was upstairs,\" Chris Metzger said. He tried to find the best way to tell his wife that they no longer had an income. \"I walked upstairs, I gave her a hug, and I said, 'I lost my job today.' \"\n\n\"I immediately fell to the floor and just started crying,\" Linda said.\n\nWithin 10 days, Chris was able to find a new job, but Linda had no such luck. The economy was taking its toll, and very few companies were hiring. They looked at their budget and started to eliminate all the extras, including dining out and gym memberships. Vacations were put on hold; furniture purchases had to wait; fine meals out were now home-cooked meals.\n\nThe Metzgers' story is playing out all across America as businesses and communities feel the ripple effect of the recession\n\n\"When jobs get lost, demand falls for a whole bunch of businesses. You're not going to buy new shoes; you're going to put new soles on them,\" said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent group that studies recessions.\n\nRestaurants where the Metzgers used to dine are now closed. The furniture store where they hoped to fill their home is having a liquidation sale and is closing in three weeks.\n\n\"You've pulled back from all your spending except paying your mortgage and putting food on the table,\" Achuthan said.\n\nIt's a sign of the times. A drive down the Phoenix streets and strip malls are filled with vacant office space .\n\nChris and Linda Metzger are expecting their first child in April. This month, they had to decide between making an expensive COBRA insurance payment or the mortgage payment, and they may have to start asking family for help.\n\nDespite her education and work experience, Linda Metzger says she is hoping she can start a genealogy business. She just doesn't feel good about jumping back into the work force after her baby is born.\n\n\"I am feeling a little burnt -- sorry, very burnt by corporate America.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nPhoenix, Arizona, couple lost three jobs in one year\n\n@highlight\n\nRestaurants, stores where they spent money are closing\n\n@highlight\n\nEconomist says when a job is lost, demand falls for many businesses", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1902, "text": "ger's office at the j"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What places are closing?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1106, "text": "jobs near Phoenix"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where were the couple from that lost three jobs in one year?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3353, "text": "ack from all your spending except paying your mortgag"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where did they spend their money?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 133, "text": "a ripple effect on other businesses in their communit"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what did an economonist say happens when a job is lost?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3190, "text": "sed to dine are"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is closing?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "How many jobs did the couple lose in one year?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who lost their jobs?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2874, "text": "ssion\\n\\n\"When jobs get lost, demand falls for"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What happens when a job is lost?", "id": "./cnn/stories/751a7a20d45a6671c53be7a852039c84dbc89fcf.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/8778e1c05fcb0af7164bf0e108731c7507b38b05.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Editor's note: Leslie Morgan Steiner is the author of \"Crazy Love,\" a new memoir about domestic violence, and the anthology \"Mommy Wars,\" which explores the polarization between stay-at-home and career moms.\n\nLeslie Morgan Steiner says domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor.\n\n(CNN) -- For two days, news reports called her \"the 20-year old victim\" allegedly attacked by R&B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWe all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna, Brown's girlfriend.\n\nThe story has dominated the general media with good reason. Both singers are young, apple-cheek gorgeous, immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you'd imagine as domestic violence headliners.\n\nPerhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture's misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor, uneducated and powerless.\n\nBrown, whose first song debuted at No. 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100, appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street, Got Milk? and Wrigley's Doublemint Gum commercials. Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label.\n\nShe has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene, attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1's with \"SOS,\" \"Umbrella,\" \"Take a Bow,\" \"Disturbia\" and T.I.'s \"Live Your Life.\"\n\nLike Rihanna, I had a bright future in my early 20s. I met my abusive lover at 22. I'd just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York.\n\nMy husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence.\n\nMany of my ex-husband's attacks also took place in our car. For reasons I never understood, the enclosed, soundproof space brought out his worst violence. He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other.\n\nAs trapped in the car as I was in our marriage, it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money, how flirtatious and naïve I was with other men, how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband's authority.\n\nSo, I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame, fury, confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing. What's hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love, hope and sympathy can be. I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he, like Chris Brown, had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home.\n\n\"He used to hit my mom ... He made me terrified all the time, terrified like I had to pee on myself,\" Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine.\n\nBrown hasn't explained what happened in the recent incident, but this week he released a statement saying that he's sorry and saddened by it.\n\nOur culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past.\n\nIn my case, it took four years, myriad terrifying attacks, and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood.\n\nI certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship, but unfortunately I was in good company. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year.\n\nEvery day, on average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. At some point in our lives, 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners, according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHowever, these statistics, grim as they are, fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle. A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children.\n\nWitnessing abuse, as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys, is a form of abuse itself. Tragically, many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. I always sensed that my husband didn't want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities.\n\nA few months after I left my marriage, I happened across another couple in another car, late at night on an empty street. I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda, brushing off a tall, handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans.\n\nSuddenly she turned and tried to run. He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront. Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face.\n\nWithout thinking, I jerked my car over and got out. By this time the man had let the woman go and she'd slid behind the wheel of the car. He stepped back as I approached, his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted. I didn't look at him. I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel, crying and staring straight ahead.\n\n\"I just left a husband who beat me for three years,\" I said. \"You do not have to put up with this. You do not deserve to be treated like this.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face. She sniffed loudly and shook her head. She wouldn't look at me. Her eyes were rimmed red, but I could see resolve in them.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said. \"It's just taking me longer than I thought.\"\n\nAs I left, I gave the man a long stare. The spell had been broken and his face was open, sorrowful, filled with hope and fear -- a look I had seen dozens of times on my husband's face.

What's interesting is how closely \"Breaking Dawn\" followed \"New Moon's\" trajectory. \"New Moon\" grossed $72.7 million its first day, and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday. By comparison, \"Breaking Dawn\" earned $72 million on Friday (the third-best opening day ever), and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today.\n\n\"New Moon\" ultimately finished its domestic run with $296.6 million, and it's too early to tell whether \"Breaking Dawn\" will wind up a bit short of that final figure. Even if it does, Summit Entertainment won't be complaining about grossing nearly $300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise. And, of course, the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here. \"Breaking Dawn\" took in $144 million from 54 foreign territories this week, pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $283.5 million.\n\nSummit reports that \"Breaking Dawn\" attracted a crowd that was, unsurprisingly, 80 percent female. What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie's audience wasn't as young as you'd think, with 60 percent over the age of 21. According to CinemaScore, 30 percent of the film's audience was under 18, but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34. The popular conception is that The \"Twilight Saga\" is merely a teenage phenomenon, but these figures seem to prove otherwise. The $110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B+ rating from CinemaScore graders.\n\nIn second place was Warner Bros.' 3-D animated sequel \"Happy Feet Two,\" which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $22 million. The 2006 original, an Oscar winner for best animated feature, opened to $41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges.\n\n\"Happy Feet Two\" was saddled with mediocre reviews, which might have discouraged some parents. Furthermore, five years could have been too long of a wait, especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor. The original \"Happy Feet\" was released a year after March of the Penguins, when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist. That moment has clearly passed. The $135 million sequel earned a B+ rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally.\n\nThe rest of the top five consisted of holdovers. The 3-D action flick \"Immortals\" dropped a harsh 62 percent for $12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both \"300\" (54 percent) and \"Clash of the Titans\" (57 percent). \"Jack and Jill\" witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $12 million. And even though \"Happy Feet Two\" underperformed, \"Puss in Boots\" lost much of its family audience. The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $10.7 million in its fourth weekend.\n\nIn limited release, Alexander Payne's \"The Descendants,\" starring George Clooney, debuted to $1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish. The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $42,150 per location. Only \"Midnight in Paris,\" \"The Tree of Life,\" and \"Jane Eyre\" opened to stronger per-theater averages this year, and those movies started out on far fewer screens than \"The Descendants.\"\n\n1.

The Web site said the letter was posted after Rafsanjani failed to respond.\n\nThe treatment of detainees at Iran's prisons has increasingly become a high profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions.\n\nIranian media reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak's chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports Saturday.\n\nA special parliamentary committee has made rounds at Tehran's Evin prison, but did not find any signs of abuse, according to recent media reports.

John Cherrey -- who commands the Air Force's 355th Fighter Wing -- told reporters that no gunman or weapon was ever found. He added that the building, where the gunman was once thought to have entered, has been secured after authorities went through it room-by-room.\n\nThe announcement came about two hours after the Air Force stated that its officials had \"terminated\" their response to the incident. All base personnel were leaving via a \"controlled release.\"\n\n\"With the help of the Tucson emergency services communities, Airmen were successful in maintaining the safety and security of the Desert Lightning Team,\" the Air Force said, alluding to the name used for Air Force personnel based in the arid southern Arizona locale.\n\nEarlier, Tucson Police Sgt. Maria Hawke said in an e-mailed statement that members of the department's SWAT team, hostage unit and bomb squad are near the site on a \"stand-by\" basis in case they are needed. But she said that they are \"not actively engaged in any enforcement, investigative or other activity.\"\n\nAnd Manuel Johnson, a Phoenix-based spokesman for the FBI, added that some agency personnel have been dispatched to the base to help, if needed.\n\nShortly before noon Friday, Staff Sgt.

I don't know....maybe I was born to believe in myself rather than in others.

I'm like two different people on-stage and off-stage,\" he told CNN's Talk Asia.\n\nChou's career was given a boost when he was spotted by Taiwanese entertainer Jacky Wu while backstage before a TV talent contest. Wu liked what he saw and introduced Chou to the music industry, at first as a songwriter for others.\n\n\"I never aimed to be a pop icon or whatever. My first album was actually a collection of songs that I wrote for other people. They didn't want them, so I made the album myself. The only aim I had was to be a singer-songwriter, not an idol,\" said Chou.\n\nDespite modest beginnings then he has reached idol status in many Asian countries, having appeared in front of crowds of tens of thousands of people across Asia and on the silver screen to millions.\n\nHis huge exposure also ensures he's the sources of constant speculation from the media about his private life.\n\n\"I think showbiz in Taiwan, or even in the Chinese-speaking region, is quite different from showbiz in the U.S. The more low-profile and tight-lipped you are, the more the paparazzi runs after you.

She was 45.\n\nComedian Joan Rivers says actress Natasha Richardson had \"such a family.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night's \"Larry King Live,\" comedian Joan Rivers remembered Richardson for her marriage to actor Liam Neeson and used her sharp wit to recall her own skiing experience.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: You knew Natasha Richardson. What was your reaction?\n\nJoan Rivers: Oh, [it] shouldn't have happened. We were more acquaintances than friends. But we spent one amazing day on a boat with my whole family and she and Liam and the boys. And they were such a family.\n\nKing: What was the occasion?\n\nRivers: We were all in the Caribbean, and we all kind of knew each other from dinner parties and so forth. And we met at the airport, and we said, \"Oh, let's get together, with the kids.\" And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling.\n\nKing: Have you seen her work on Broadway?\n\nRivers: I've seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in \"The Philadelphia Story\" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that.\n\nKing: What was your read on them as a couple that day?\n\nRivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That's what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn't have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect.\n\nKing: How did you learn of this yesterday?\n\nRivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha? I said, what are you talking about? And he said, she's brain-dead.  Watch King talk to celebrities about Richardson »\n\nKing: So you knew yesterday?\n\nRivers: I knew yesterday. And I knew yesterday that she was brain-dead. And I was told, which is, again, so dear, that they kept her alive purposely to bring her back to New York, so that the boys could say goodbye to her before --\n\nKing: Really?\n\nRivers: Yes.\n\nKing: That's both beautiful and sad.\n\nRivers: Look at this, it gets me crazy. It's sad.\n\nKing: Do you ski?\n\nRivers: I had a terrible fall about 12 years ago. And I lay there in the snow and I said to myself, \"If I get up, I'm not coming back and I got up.\"\n\nKing: You're like, \"Goodbye.\"\n\nRivers: Goodbye. And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, \"If everything works, that's it. That's it.\"\n\nKing: You've heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously. It was a slight fall?\n\nRivers: You don't know; you hit your head wrong. You walk out of your house and it's over. We all know that, especially at this age. You understand that it's over, it's gone. It's just not that [Richardson's] age, not with a good marriage, not with two young boys. It shouldn't be.\n\nKing: John Kennedy said life isn't fair.\n\nRivers: It isn't. It isn't.

But it's a resolute step in view of our company's strategic realignment.\"\n\nThe team currently lie eighth in the constructors' world championship with eight points after 10 rounds and of their two drivers -- Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld -- Heidfeld sits a lowly 13th in the drivers' championship with just six points.\n\nBMW are the second manufacturer to pull out of F1 in a further blow to the sport after Honda's withdrawal before the start of the 2009 season.  CNN's analysis of BMW's exit from Formula One. »\n\nHowever, since Wednesday's announcement, rival German car manufacturer Mercedes have reconfirmed their commitment to the sport.\n\n\"We regret the withdrawal of BMW from Formula One. This decision will not have the slightest influence on our commitment to Formula One,\" a spokesman for the company told AFP.\n\nMotorsport's world governing body, the FIA, reiterated their belief that the move was an indication of how the global economic downturn was affecting the sport.\n\nIn a statement on their official Web site, they said: \"The FIA regrets the announcement of BMW's intended withdrawal from Formula One but is not surprised by it. It has been clear for some time that motor sport cannot ignore the world economic crisis.\n\n\"Car manufacturers cannot be expected to continue to pour large sums of money into Formula One when their survival depends on redundancies, plant closures and the support of the taxpayer. This is why the FIA prepared regulations to reduce costs drastically.\n\n\"These measures were needed to alleviate the pressure on manufacturers following Honda's withdrawal but also to make it possible for new teams to enter. Had these regulations not been so strongly opposed by a number of team principals, the withdrawal of BMW and further such announcements in the future might have been avoided,\" the statement added.\n\nBMW entered Formula One with a takeover of the Sauber F1 team in 2005 and finished fifth in the constructors' championship in their debut campaign, before racing under their own name in 2006.\n\nWith an aggressive aim of winning the world championship within three years, the team came close in 2007 finishing second to Ferrari, thanks largely to the exclusion of McLaren-Mercedes from the manufacturer's points standings. In 2008, the team captured third, thanks in part to a first win in the Canadian Grand Prix for Polish driver Kubica.\n\nThe statement continued: \"It only took us three years to establish ourselves as a top team with the BMW Sauber F1 team. Unfortunately, the team were unable to meet expectations in the current season.\"\n\nThe car-builder was also unable to \"quantify redundancies\" that may come from the move which follows the exit of  Honda in December.\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer -- who according to FIA president Max Mosley were spending $500m a season to compete in the sport -- cited the \"sudden contraction of the world economies\" as their reason to end racing.\n\nThis led to Mosley spearheading an FIA plan to enforce controversial cost-cutting measures on the teams for the 2010 season. The Formula One furor explained.\n\nThese measures, which split opinion within the sport, are expected to be adopted in a watered-down form and could eventually save $60 million from the cost of running a team, according to Mosley.\n\nHowever, the FIA were prompted by BMW's exit to warn again that if the measures were weakened too much the positive impact on the sport could be reduced.\n\n\"As a result of a sustained cost-cutting campaign by the FIA, new measures are in the process of being agreed which should make it easier for new teams to enter and enable existing ones to participate on much reduced budgets.\n\n\"It is no secret that these measures do not go as far as the FIA would have liked but a compromise was needed in the interests of harmony in the sport. Hopefully it will be enough to prevent further withdrawals and provide a solid foundation for Formula One,\" the statement read.\n\n@highlight\n\nBMW announce that they are to leave Formula One at the

lawyers said Tuesday.\n\nAmman protesters support Muntazer al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist held for throwing his shoes at President Bush.\n\nMuntadhir Al-Zaidi was due to go on trial Wednesday, but the Criminal Court postponed it pending an appeal filed by his lawyers with the Federal Court of Appeal, a spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council, Abdul Sattar Bayrakdar, said.\n\nDhiya al-Saadi, who leads Al-Zaidi's 25-member legal team, confirmed the postponement.\n\nAl-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at Bush two weeks ago during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad.\n\nNeither shoe hit the president, and others in the room quickly knocked Al-Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him.\n\nMany Iraqis hail Al-Zaidi, who faces a prison term if convicted, as a hero. More than 1,000 lawyers have volunteered to defend him, al-Saadi said.\n\nThe lawyers' appeal asked the Federal Court to change Al-Zaidi's case from assaulting Bush to insulting him. If Al-Zaidi is convicted of the former, he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, al-Saadi said.\n\nThe lawyers are trying to persuade the appeals court that Al-Zaidi did not want to harm Bush by throwing the shoes, but simply wanted to insult him. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world.\n\nAl-Saadi said he met with his client several days ago but was having difficulty meeting with him again. He did not give the reason he was not allowed to see Al-Zaidi but said many lawyers have trouble meeting with detainees in Iraqi or U.S. custody.\n\nIt will take at least two weeks for the court to set a new date for Al-Zaidi's trial, legal expert Tariz Harab said.\n\nCNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nTrial of Iraqi journalist who threw shoes at U.S. President Bush delayed\n\n@highlight\n\nMuntadhir Al-Zaidi faces jail if convicted; trial was due to start Wednesday\n\n@highlight\n\nMany Iraqis hail the shoe thrower has a hero; mass protests followed his arrest\n\n@highlight\n\nAt least two weeks before new trial date set, legal experts say", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 377, "text": "Wednesday,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When was the trial due to start?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 245, "text": "Muntazer al-Zaidi,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the name of the journalist who threw a shoe at Bush?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 245, "text": "Muntazer al-Zaidi,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who faces jail?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 245, "text": "Muntazer al-Zaidi,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Trial of who is delayed?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 119, "text": "has been postponed,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What happened to the trial?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 245, "text": "Muntazer al-Zaidi,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Whose trial is delayed?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 9, "text": "Iraq"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What country is journalist Muntadhir Al-Zaidi from?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 335, "text": "Muntadhir Al-Zaidi"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who faces jail if convicted?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1791, "text": "at least two weeks"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How long before the new trials date?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 79, "text": "his shoes"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did an Iraqi journalist throw at President Bush?", "id": "./cnn/stories/aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f24225ef0e0b719208c4055c7d7e0f16a362d3d7.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- Buy a $175,000 package to attend the Oscars and you might buy yourself trouble, lawyers for the Academy Awards warn.\n\nThe 81st annual Academy Awards will be held on February 22 from Hollywood's Kodak Theatre.\n\nThe advertising of such packages -- including four tickets to the upcoming 81st annual Academy Awards and a hotel stay in Los Angeles, California -- has prompted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to sue an Arizona-based company.\n\nThe Academy accused the company Experience 6 of selling \"black-market\" tickets, because tickets to the lavish movie awards show cannot be transferred or sold.\n\nSelling tickets could become a security issue that could bring celebrity stalkers or terrorists to the star-studded event, says the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in the Central District of California.\n\n\"Security experts have advised the Academy that it must not offer tickets to members of the public and must know identities of the event attendees,\" the lawsuit says.\n\n\"In offering such black-market tickets, defendants are misleading the public and the ticket buyers into thinking that purchasers will be welcomed guests, rather than as trespassers, when they arrive for the ceremony.\"\n\nExperience 6 did not return calls from CNN for comment.

Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service »\n\nIt began with Jackson's five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries.\n\nHis three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father's coffin, which a family spokesman said it was \"to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop.\"\n\nJackson's children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them.\n\nAfter an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow.\"\n\nClifton Davis sang \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers.\n\nWhat was said by Jackson's father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony. A family statement issued afterward said close friends and family, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke \"spontaneously to celebrate Michael's life.\"\n\nNews helicopters hovering above captured video from a distance, but without sound.  Watch media cover Jackson funeral »\n\nLisa Marie Presley, one of Jackson's former wives and the daughter of Elvis, attended the service, according to the family statement. It did not mention Debbie Rowe, Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two oldest children.\n\nMacaulay Culkin, the \"Home Alone\" actor who spent time with Jackson during his Neverland Ranch days, was there with his girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis.\n\nActors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker were also seen arriving for the service.\n\nMotown founder Berry Gordy, who gave Jackson and his brothers their first big record deal, and Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson's \"Thriller\" album, were there. Music producer Teddy Riley, who helped with Jackson's 1991 \"Dangerous\" album, attended.\n\nThe guest list included TV executive Suzanne de Passe, who produced a miniseries about Jackson's family, and Kenny Ortega,  who was producing Jackson's comeback show.\n\nThomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in a child molestation trial, sat just behind the Jackson family.\n\nWhen the hour-long service ended, his brothers lifted Jackson's casket for a final time to carry him inside the Great Mausoleum, where he was placed in his crypt at 9:43 p.m. PT (12:43 a.m. ET Friday).\n\nThe family statement said it was \"his final resting place.\"\n\nThe family and friends then drove to an Italian restaurant eight miles away, in Pasadena, California, for \"a time of celebration.\"\n\nThe massive mausoleum, the final resting place for Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities, is normally open to tourists, though the public is denied close access to crypts. Security guards, aided by cameras, keep constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture.\n\nThe Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, \"has been called the 'New World's Westminster Abbey' by Time Magazine.\"\n\nVisitors will see \"exact replicas of Michelangelo's greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci's immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world's largest paintings,\" the Web site says.\n\nJackson's burial was delayed by division among family members, though Katherine Jackson would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN.\n\nHe preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California.\n\nThat idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted.\n\nThe mystery of where Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death.\n\nAfter his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours after his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy.\n\nIt was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena.\n\nAgain, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. It was only recently confirmed that it was taken back to the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision.\n\nThough Thursday's interment may settle one Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death.\n\nLos Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.\n\n@highlight\n\nJackson's three kids, led by daughter, Paris, placed a crown atop their father's coffin\n\n@highlight\n\nClifton Davis sang \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5\n\n@highlight\n\nGuests included Elizabeth Taylor, Lisa Marie Presley and Macaulay Culkin", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 33, "text": "Michael Jackson's family"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What famous guests were there?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1627, "text": "Clifton Davis"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who sang Never Can Say Goodbye?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2953, "text": "TV executive Suzanne de Passe,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what other important guest were included at the funeral?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 760, "text": "including Elizabeth Taylor"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who were amongst the guests?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1646, "text": "\"Never Can Say Goodbye,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what song did Clifton Davis sang?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1186, "text": "Paris,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who led Jacksons kids?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1153, "text": "three children,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "How many kids did Jackson have?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1694, "text": "Jackson 5"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who sang \"Never Can Say Goodbye\"?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1186, "text": "Paris,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what is the name of Jackson's Daughter?", "id": "./cnn/stories/0246f64a1da528ea94bd1d3b17562a2fda8938f6.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f31105c161b891e4092c275a68164e4a99302fb6.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Most conservationists would agree that you should not interfere with mother nature.

Post your comments to the Screening Room blog and we'll publish the best.\n\nRead other CNN viewers' favorite and worst family films, and tell us yours >>\n\n1. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982) Spielberg's magic captures a perfect moment in childhood. We laughed and wept as his ugly little critter from outer space stole our hearts, while the kids fell firmly on the cute side of annoying. And oh, the music...\n\n2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, 1971) Gene Wilder's whacked-out Willy Wonka adds a pinch of sinister to Roald Dahl's anarchic sweet treat, while the ignoble exits of Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop and Mike Teevee were delicious.\n\n3. Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) \"That'll do, pig.\" Babe is wide-eyed with wonder in Dick King-Smith's touching tale of a lonely little sheep-pig. Comic relief from the ewes, subtle special effects and a heartwarming turn from James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett make this a magical tale for all.\n\n4. Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker, 1976) Jodie Foster and Scott Baio (Yes, Chachi from \"Happy Days!\") star in this glorious escapade set in a musical world of pint-sized gangsters and mini-molls. Al Capone for the kids; just watch out for the splurge guns...\n\n5. Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968) Jack Wild is delightful as the Artful Dodger, Ron Moody's devilish Fagin glints with avaricious greed and Shani Willis shines as poor, ill-fated Nancy. But it's Oliver Reed's dark and sinister Bill Sykes who stayed with us -- and left us wanting more.\n\n6. Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis, 1985) Christopher Lloyd's mad professor, a Delorean-cum-time machine, rock 'n' roll and a convenient bolt of lightning see Biff the bully get his come-uppance. All that, and a skateboarding Michael J. Fox? Mr Zemeckis, you spoil us!\n\n7. Home Alone (Chris Columbus, 1990) Macaulay Culkin's abandoned little boy sees off bungling burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern with a series of eye-watering stunts. It proves just how great a child actor Culkin was; pity the unpopular babysitters who became the victims of copycat pranksters...\n\n8. Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis blast ghostly green monsters to oblivion in this slime-filled romp around NYC, while taking time out to annoy Sigourney Weaver en route. Who you gonna call?\n\n9. The Muppet Movie (James Frawley, 1979) Kermit and Co.'s roadtrip to Hollywood is a fabulously fuzzy tale of friendship and following your dreams, but the Muppet Movie's not just for kids: there's cameos a-plenty (Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, ORSON WELLES!) for Dad and smart one-liners by the bucketful for Mom.\n\n10. Harry Potter (Various, 2001-present) The Hogwarts trio's wizarding adventures, backed by a cast plump with the best of British actors. Fast-paced plots, spellbinding special effects and magical sets, but be warned: it'll have the li'l critters pestering you to go to boarding school...\n\nAnd our favorite hide-behind-the-sofa moments...\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939) \"I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!\" Margaret Hamilton's green, cackling Wicked Witch of the West is hell-bent on revenging the death of her sister and getting those ruby slippers; she'll use deadly poppies and flying monkeys to do it. Terror as a rite of passage.\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (Ken Hughes, 1968) With his battered top hat and lank hair, Robert Helpmann's creepy Child Catcher prowled from Vulgaria into our nightmares, hoping to catch a whiff of his prey with his unfeasibly long nose. The only film character to give the Wicked Witch of the West a run for her money.\n\nStar Wars (George Lucas, 1977) Darth Vader may cast a formidable shadow, but it's the sound of his labored breathing that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up -- as it gets closer, closer, closer...\n\nGhostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Rule 475 of Surviving the Movies: Never go into the basement! The thick silence in New York's Central Library masks a phantom infestation -- and they're not going quietly. As the gray-haired librarian switched to shrieking ghoul, a generation of children was put off reading for life.\n\nJurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) And again, it's the sound effects that make the Velociraptors so scary -- as the frighteningly intelligent pack of lizards hunt for Lex and Tim among the kitchen workbenches, their hissing grows ever nearer...\n\nDon't agree?

Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar.\n\nThe ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of \"change\" is not without some serious pitfalls.\n\nWhen the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city \"Embrace the Change!\" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin.\n\nThe Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was \"once involved with those desires and those thoughts\" but was able to get past them through prayer.\n\nTo say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nJohn Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was \"sucking up to anti-gay bigots\" and \"giving them a stage.\"\n\nWhen the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise.\n\nObama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching \"40 Days of Faith and Family\" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate.\n\nCampaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a \"Christian family man,\" that aired on gospel stations across the state.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that \"I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth.\"\n\nAfter that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values.\n\n\"I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,\" Obama said. \"At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away.\"\n\nBut on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks.\n\nObama issued a statement saying, \"I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,\" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans.\n\nA September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that \"sex between two adults of the same sex\" is \"strongly unacceptable.\"\n\nObama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia.\n\nSolomonese was not completely assuaged.\n\n\"I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage.\"\n\nThe State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia.\n\nPrivately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences.\n\nWill Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.

Christchurch. \"Obviously, power's out -- sort of all over the city at the moment -- and phone lines are down.\"\n\nPolice evacuated sections of the city's central business district after reports of a possible gas leak, police said. Several bridges in the city were closed as a precaution.\n\n\"It was quite an exciting ride,\" Christchurch Police Acting Inspector Murray Hurst told CNN after the first quake, adding that there was some damage caused by the quake and a few injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe first quake -- a magnitude 5.2 -- was centered 9 kilometers (5 miles) east-southeast of Christchurch at a depth of 11 kilometers (6.8 miles), according to USGS.

He was 90.\n\nGriffin Bell is sworn in as attorney general in January 1977.\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter issued a statement saying that he and former first lady Rosalynn Carter were deeply saddened by Bell's death.\n\n\"A trusted and enduring public figure, Griffin's integrity, professionalism, and charm were greatly valued across party lines and presidential administrations,\" Carter said.\n\n\"As a World War II veteran, federal appeals court judge, civil rights advocate, and U.S. attorney general in my administration, Griffin made many lasting contributions to his native Georgia and country. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.\"\n\nThe son of a south Georgia cotton farmer, Bell passed the Georgia bar exam while still a student in law school, according to the New Georgia Encyclopedia. He went on to help build the prominent Atlanta law firm King and Spalding, and then to serve as the nation's top legal officer.\n\nHe was a chairman of John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign, and Kennedy appointed him to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961. As a federal judge, Bell was involved in desegregation rulings in the 1960s, and he became known as a moderate legal voice in the South.\n\nFellow Georgian Jimmy Carter nominated Bell as attorney general in 1976.

the folks in Orme, Tennessee. Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening.\n\nA 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee.\n\nThe mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state.\n\nEvery day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry.\n\n\"When they cut it back on we jump for joy,\" Orme resident Debbie Cash said. \"And then you only have it for three hours.\"\n\nThree hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done.

Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River.\n\n\"All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river isn't far behind,\" Reames said.  See photos of a Atlanta's shrinking Lake Lanier reservoir »\n\nVolunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2½ miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day.\n\nBridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesn't charge its neighbor.

She delivered this commentary during the \"Cutting through the Bull\" segment of Tuesday night's broadcast.\n\nCNN's Campbell Brown says \"having no life\" isn't a requirement for a man to get a job.\n\n(CNN) -- How many times have politicians been warned about the dangers of an open microphone? And yet, on Tuesday, the lectern mic at the National Governors Conference picked up this little nugget from Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.\n\nHe's having a conversation near the lectern about President-elect Barack Obama's choice for to lead the Homeland Security Department, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Here is what Rendell said about Napolitano:\n\nRendell: Janet's perfect for that job. Because for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it\n\nWow. Now, I'm sure Gov. Napolitano has many qualifications for the job beyond having no family, and therefore the ability to devote 20 hours a day to the job.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary »\n\nBut it is fascinating to me that that is the quality being highlighted here as so perfect. C'mon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is married with two grown children. His predecessor, Tom Ridge, had a family. Anybody remember a debate about whether they would have trouble balancing the demands of work and family?\n\nNow, I am a fan of Gov. Rendell. He has been on this show many times. I like him for his candor. In our attempts to cut through the bull, he delivers far less bull than most politicians. But it is his frankness here that raises so many questions.\n\n1. If a man had been Obama's choice for the job, would having a family or not having a family ever even have been an issue? Would it have ever prompted a comment? Probably not. We all know the assumption tends to be that with a man, there is almost always a wife in the wings managing those family concerns.\n\n2. As a woman, hearing this, it is hard not to wonder if we are counted out for certain jobs, certain opportunities, because we do have a family or because we are in our child-bearing years. Are we? It is a fair question.\n\n3. If you are a childless, single woman with suspicions that you get stuck working holidays, weekends and the more burdensome shifts more often than your colleagues with families, are those suspicions well-founded? Probably so. Is there an assumption that if you're family-free then you have no life? By some, yes.\n\nAgain Gov. Rendell, I don't mean to rake you over the coals. I know what you meant to say. But your comments do perpetuate stereotypes that put us in boxes, both mothers and single women.\n\nIn government and beyond, men have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to striking the right work-life balance. Women are owed the same consideration.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.\n\n@highlight\n\nRendell says choice for Homeland Security good because she has \"no life\"\n\n@highlight\n\nBrown: Janet Napolitano has many qualifications beyond having no family\n\n@highlight\n\nNobody would have said the same about a male candidate, Brown says\n\n@highlight\n\nWomen deserve same treatment as men on work-life issues, she says", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 976, "text": "itano"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is a qualification that Janet Napolitano has?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3819baf67ba4870128b3893c900ba72413ff32c9.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 777, "text": "endell: Janet's perfect for th"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did Rendell say regarding why she's a good choice?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3819baf67ba4870128b3893c900ba72413ff32c9.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2855, "text": "to striking the ri"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What types of issues should men and women be treated equally on, according to the reading?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3819baf67ba4870128b3893c900ba72413ff32c9.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Brown says what about work-life issues?", "id": "./cnn/stories/3819baf67ba4870128b3893c900ba72413ff32c9.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2889, "text": "alance.

The judge ruled that the mother -- who is separated from the girl's father -- was not the child's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, according to the mother's lawyer, Abdullah al-Jutaili.\n\nHowever, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili said. The lawyer said in the original marriage agreement, the father of the girl stipulated that the marriage would not be consummated until she was 18.\n\nThe judge also ruled that the girl could file a petition for a divorce when she reached puberty, al-Jutaili said.\n\nThe young girl lives with her mother, the attorney said, and was never told that she was married.\n\nWhen the initial petition to annul the marriage was rejected, the mother appealed the verdict to an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The appeals court declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration.\n\nUnder the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect but that a challenge to the marriage was ongoing.\n\nEarlier this month, the original judge refused for a second time to annul the marriage.\n\nSoon after that decision, Saudi Arabia's justice minister told Al-Watan that he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages.\n\nThe law will place restrictions on the practice to preserve the rights of children and prevent abuses, Justice Minister Mohammed Al-Issa was quoted as saying. Additionally, al-Issa said there would be a study of a system that will include regulations for the marriage of minors and everything related to such unions, the newspaper reported. No details on the restrictions or regulations were mentioned.\n\nThe minister did not say whether child marriage would be abolished.\n\nResponding to the justice minister's comments and the possibility of a new child marriage law, al-Jutaili told CNN at the time, \"this is what we requested from day one, and we know that Saudi officials are working so hard on resolving this issue.\"\n\nAl-Jutaili believes that such a law would help not only his defendant but many other Saudi minors facing a similar problem.\n\nIn Washington Monday, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns called the marriage a human rights abuse.\n\n\"Child marriage is, unfortunately, still common in much of Saudi Arabia and we have voiced our concern about this practice at the highest levels,\" he told a conference on U.S.-Saudi relations. \"We were encouraged by reports that the Justice Ministry had begun to review the legal age of marriage.\"\n\nAfter the divorce was denied for a second time, the head of the United Nations Children's Fund issued a statement expressing concern about the case.\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said, \"the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision.\"\n\nThe issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative Saudi kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed.\n\n\"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,\" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. \"A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her.\"\n\nAl-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry.\n\n\"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women.\"\n\nSharia law is Islamic law, and Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism.\n\n@highlight\n\nChild bride wins divorce hearing at third attempt, local media reports\n\n@highlight\n\nHer case attracted attention of the U.N. and governments around the world\n\n@highlight\n\nHer father reportedly arranged the marriage to settle his debts\n\n@highlight\n\nSaudi justice minister says he plans law to protect young girls from such marriages", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2720, "text": "as saying.

All three pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the three \"knowingly and intentionally\" conspired to intimidate African-Americans \"in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right ... and because of having so exercised that right, to wit, the right to vote.\"\n\nNicoletti and Carranza are white, and Contreras is Latino. They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAt the arraignment, Nicoletti and Contreras were ordered held without bail, while Carranza was released on a $200,000 bond but ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device.\n\nContreras' attorney, public defender Len Kamdang, could not be reached for comment. Nicoletti's attorney, Bob LaRusso, had no comment.\n\nProsecutors said in court filings that on the night of November 4, the defendants were at a \"makeshift outdoor clubhouse\" in the Rosebank section of Staten Island when they learned of Obama's victory. At that point, prosecutors said, Nicoletti drove Contreras, Carranza and another friend to the predominantly African-American Park Hill neighborhood in Staten Island.\n\nTheir purpose, prosecutors said, was to assault African-Americans because of Obama's win.\n\nTheir first victim, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office, was 17-year-old Ali Kamara, whom they beat with a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton. Kamara escaped after suffering a concussion and injuries to his legs.\n\n\"The first swing that swung -- it hit my head. It cut my head,\" Kamara told CNN affiliate WABC. \"I got staples on my head now.\"\n\nKamara said he hid in a neighbor's backyard until the boys moved on.\n\nContinuing to the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, the group assaulted a second African-American man, pushing him down, the federal prosecutors alleged. They then allegedly accosted a Latino man, demanding to know how he voted, and shouted profanities about Obama at a group of African-Americans at a hair salon.\n\nNext, prosecutors said, the group targeted Ronald Forte, a man they mistakenly believed to be African-American who was walking along Blackford Avenue in predominantly African-American Port Richmond. Forte is white, but because he was wearing a hoodie, the men were unable to identify his race and assumed that he was African-American.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the men decided to assault Forte with the police baton as they drove by, but at the last moment, Nicoletti swerved the vehicle directly into the 38-year-old man instead. Forte was thrown onto the hood of the car, shattering the front windshield.\n\nAccording to Staten Island Real Time News (silive.com), Forte was in a coma for 45 days, returning to his family's home in New Jersey in mid-December, said his mother, Eileen. She added that her son now has serious brain damage and motor control problems.\n\n\"He's not good. He's never going to be good,\" she said. \"Every day, I just see something different, and it's so scary.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney Benton J.

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running neck and neck toward the party's August convention in Denver, Colorado. Most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then.\n\nParty rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers, elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance. The party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention.\n\nBut even some superdelegates are questioning the system, as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome.\n\n\"It's not the most democratic way of doing things,\" said Maine superdelegate Sam Spencer.  Watch the scenario for a \"civil war\" in the Democratic Party »\n\nAt least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses.\n\nMoveOn.org, which has endorsed Obama, is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in USA Today. And Democracy for America, headed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean's brother Jim, said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates.\n\nWhile pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus, superdelegates are free to vote however they want. And even if they pledge their support to a candidate, they're free to change at any time.\n\nClinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157. But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates, 1,096 to 977, and is on a roll, having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday.  See which states pledged delegates come from »\n\nIf the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote, the turmoil would last long beyond the convention, longtime Democratic Party strategist Tad Devine said.\n\n\"If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses, but by politicians in some mythical backroom, I think that the public could react strongly against that,\" Devine said.\n\n\"The problem is [if] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead, insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process, particularly the young people who are voting for the first time, will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated,\" he said.\n\nSuperdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate Democrats back to conventions, where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s, and to relect the party's mainstream more accurately.\n\n\"[Superdelegates] are the keepers of the faith,\" said former San Francisco, California, Mayor Willie Brown. \"You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party. You don't want the bleed-over from the Green Party, the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be.\"\n\nDevine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984.\n\nMondale's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former Sen. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson. Mondale had received more votes, but Hart had won more states.\n\nMondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor.\n\nEach campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side.\n\nJason Rae, a 21-year-old Wisconsin superdelegate, said he's gotten calls from former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from Hillary Clinton's camp, and Obama's wife, Michelle, visited with him during a campaign stop Tuesday in Wisconsin.\n\nRae said he hasn't yet decided how he'll vote in Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday.\n\nCrystal Strait, a party activist from California, said she's received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted.\n\nMassachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he'll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh's state. So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry.\n\nAmong Clinton's committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr., her husband's former deputy chief of staff; Terry McAuliffe, who led her husband's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign; and her husband.\n\nWhether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates, even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote, could split the party.\n\n\"It's in a total contradiction of the way the Democrats have set up their primary process, with all this proportional representation,\" said CNN political analyst Amy Holmes. \"The whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites. And if this is decided by superdelegates, I think the Democratic Party morally is going to be looking at each other and say, 'What did we just do?' \"\n\nDevine said it could hurt the party in the general election.\n\n\"I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we're saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness, whether it's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance, there's a fairness component in all of that,\" he said. \"People need to believe, I think, that our process is fair as well, if they want to believe that our policies will be fair.\" E-mail to a friend\n\nCNN's Campbell Brown, John Helton and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nDemocrats' system includes about 800 superdelegates -- party officials, leaders\n\n@highlight\n\nUnlike elected delegates, superdelegates can vote for any candidate they choose\n\n@highlight\n\nSome says they fear superdelegates could tip balance against the popular vote\n\n@highlight\n\nIf such a thing happens, some say voters will feel alienated, disenfranchised", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 594, "text": "800 or so"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What number of superdelegates was there?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 38, "text": "their party's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What do some people fear?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1646, "text": "superdelegates are free to vote however they want."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who can superdelegates vote for?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Do superdelegates get to choose their vote?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 573, "text": "of superdelegates"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What could tip the balance against the popular vote?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 5836, "text": "our process"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Do voters think this is a fair system?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 594, "text": "800 or so"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What number of superdelegates are there?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2408, "text": "public could react strongly against that,\""}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What would happen to voters?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What is the difference between delegates and superdelegates?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 594, "text": "800 or so"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the number of superdelegates?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 658, "text": "tip the balance."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What can superdelegates do?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 473, "text": "2,025"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is the number of superdelegates for the Democrats?", "id": "./cnn/stories/58bf14c936eb7e9a6561599014fefd77ef6c457e.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- NASA won't have to maneuver the international space station to dodge a piece of debris from a Soviet-era satellite spinning around Earth, the space agency announced Monday.\n\nNASA says debris won't threaten the international space station, seen here from Endeavour in November 2008.\n\nMission controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston warned earlier that a piece of the Kosmos 1275 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early Tuesday morning.

It passed within 3 miles of the station early Thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way, controllers said. iReport.com: See, share your photos of launches and space\n\nCain called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a \"random\" occurrence, but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk.\n\n\"It's part of the business,\" he said. \"It comes with the territory, and we'll continue to do whatever's necessary to avoid debris.\"\n\nCNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.\n\n@highlight\n\nAvoidance maneuver not necessary to avoid satellite debris\n\n@highlight\n\nThe exact size of the Soviet-era debris is unknown, scientists say\n\n@highlight\n\nSpace station crew earlier was forced to take shelter because of other debris", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1583, "text": "a piece of debris"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the space station crew forced to take shelter from?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 37, "text": "the international space station"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What maneuver is unnecessary to avoid satellite debris?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 195, "text": "debris won't threaten the international space station,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did scientists say?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1067, "text": "dimensions"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is unknown about the Soviet-era debris?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1612, "text": "space station's current crew"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was forced to take shelter?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who was forced to take shelter from the debris?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 28, "text": "maneuver the international space station"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is not necessary?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What type of debris is trying to be avoided?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 103, "text": "Soviet-era"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What era is the debris from?", "id": "./cnn/stories/bce33bb5b5cff6b93065aa0cf91917c8dd36ac78.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a453a783cd7f423053b7e56dc5e81fdeec92c468.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- It was classic Clinton.\n\nIt was Sen. Hillary Clinton's big night but before her speech even began, former President Bill Clinton reached out in his box and firmly embraced a young African-American man.\n\nClinton gripped the young man tightly; to millions watching on television, it was clear he could feel Mervyn Jones Jr.'s pain.\n\nAs he sat down for his wife's headlining address, Bill Clinton's silent embrace of the 25-year-old son of recently deceased Ohio Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones resonated loudly.\n\nRep. Tubbs Jones, of course, was a solid and loyal Clinton supporter, standing by the Clintons even when many other black leaders were shifting their support to Barack Obama.\n\nThen, in her speech, Sen. Clinton herself took a moment to mention Tubbs Jones and her son.\n\n\"Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all,\" Clinton said. \"Our heart goes out to Stephanie's son, Mervyn Jr.\"\n\nThe public moment of recognition was the result of years of friendship.\n\n\" I remember the first time President Clinton ran for office [in 1992],\" Jones Jr. told CNN. \"He came to Cleveland. I must have been 8 years old.\n\n\"My mother got the chance to meet him. ... They have been best of friends ever since,\" he said.\n\nAnd, perhaps, it was also a reminder that if you stand by the Clintons, the Clintons will stand by you.\n\nTubbs Jones endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in April 2007 but with Sen. Barack Obama's success during the primaries, many African-American superdelegates came under pressure to back Obama instead.\n\nTubbs Jones, however, held steadfast even as others in her position switched their allegiance.\n\n\"I'm going to be with her until she says, 'Stephanie, I'm no longer in this fight. You're free to do something else,'\" Tubbs Jones told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in March. \"In politics, all you have is your word,\" she added.\n\nShe passed that same sense of commitment on to her son.\n\n\"If you give somebody your word, you're going to go ahead and do it,\" Jones Jr. said the day after Hillary Clinton's address to the Democratic National Convention. \"Otherwise, it's not worth anything.\"\n\n\"The same goes in politics,\" he added. \"If you don't have your word, you don't really have anything to stand on in politics. So, that's one thing I did learn [from my mother] at a very early age.\"\n\nWhen Sen. Clinton asked Jones Jr. to sit with her husband during what was perhaps her most important speech to date, he agreed.\n\n\"She always said that if you don't stick by somebody in the bad times, you never know how good the good times are going to be,\" Jones Jr. said, explaining his mother's view of loyalty.\n\nTubbs Jones, 58, died suddenly a week ago of a brain aneurysm. She was in her fifth term in the House of Representatives and was the first African-American woman to represent Ohio in the House.\n\nWhat would Tubbs Jones have thought of Sen. Clinton's call Tuesday for Democrats to unify behind Obama?\n\n\"She would've been standing up, hooting and hollering saying, 'Wow. That's exactly what we needed. Way to be a team player,'\" Jones Jr. said.\n\nIn what some political analysts were calling the first speech of her second campaign for president, Hillary Clinton did her part on stage.\n\nAnd, in the box, her husband held on tightly to the son of an old friend ­and sent a message of his own that may resonate as an important moment in the long-term resurrection of the Clinton brand in American politics.\n\n@highlight\n\nBill Clinton's silent embrace of  Rep.

Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins.\n\nFuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view.\n\nNext week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout).\n\nThe Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies.\n\nThe Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji.\n\nHowever an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that.\n\nBehind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout.\n\nThe redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia.\n\nSo how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation.\n\nComputer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself.\n\nDespite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum.\n\nThe circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance).\n\nThen the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car.\n\n\"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,\" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team.\n\nDieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains:\n\n\"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions.\n\n\"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried.\"\n\nOne peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends.\n\n\"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,\" says Glass, \"and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed.\"\n\nThe testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities:\n\n\"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,\" says Rampf.\n\nNot that everything can be predicted: \"I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,\" continues Glass.\n\n\"Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.\" E-mail to a friend\n\n@highlight\n\nRe-designed Fuji Speedway to host its first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977\n\n@highlight\n\nSuzuka to alternate with Fuji from 2009\n\n@highlight\n\nComputer models used to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit", "qas": [{"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What way are teams being prepared for familar circuit", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2117, "text": "e redesign of t"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which is re designed?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 692, "text": "nce 1"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "when did fuji speedway host the first japanese grand prix", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1649, "text": "Fuji a"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which other circuit will alternate with Fuji?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 692, "text": "nce 1"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When was the last time Fuji Speedway hosted the Japanese Grand Prix?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who are computer models being used for in preparation of unfamiliar circuits?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1168, "text": "\\n\\nThe Suzuk"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When is first Japanese Grand Prix hosted?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1450, "text": "aled th"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who alternates with Fuji from 2009?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What is used  to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2934, "text": "ing their cars on a vi"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is preparing teams?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1593, "text": "on of the Japanese G"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When will Suzuka alternate with Fuji from?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 398, "text": "a scale model of the ne"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is used to prepare teams for the circuit?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 633, "text": "the Fuji Speedw"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where will the first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977 be hosted?", "id": "./cnn/stories/a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/cf3d6b0d4ad14c6920ff2105defd2feb612ec6c7.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Searchers have recovered the bodies of three people who were aboard a Yemenia Airways jet that crashed off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, a spokesman for Yemen's Civil Aviation department said Tuesday.\n\nA man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France.\n\nCapt.

Qadir said the jet took off from Sanaa shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni.\n\nSearchers have not located the plane's data recorders, Qadir said, and investigators were not speculating on the cause of the crash.\n\n\"The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),\" he said. \"That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport.\"\n\nBut French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that several years ago France banned the plane, a A310-300, because of safety concerns.\n\n\"People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,\" Bussereau said. \"It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful because none of this information is verified.\"\n\nQadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash.\n\n\"This plane is just like any other plane,\" he said. \"It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash.\"\n\nIt was the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month.

And Airbus has hundreds of millions of hours flying safely. I don't believe that ... we can draw any conclusions because the manufacturer was the same in these two very different types of accidents.\"\n\nAt first, Comoros officials said there were no signs of survivors among the dead bodies floating in the choppy waters. But then rescuers found the child.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue »\n\nCox said it reminded him of the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255 in Detroit, Michigan, in which only a 4-year-old girl survived while 156 others died.\n\n\"This has come up before, and it's where the toddler was seated (during the impact) that allowed them to survive,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a miracle and I'm glad ... the toddler is safe. I'm just saddened for the loss of everybody else,\" he added.\n\nThe Yemeni crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni. The plane tried to land, then U-turned before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. Officials did not know why the plane could not land, he said.\n\nFlight 626 was expected to be a four-and-a-half-hour flight. The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni, off the east coast of Africa, about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) south of Yemen.\n\nThe crash occurred about 1:30 a.m., Nadhoim said.\n\nThere was no indication of foul play behind the crash, the official in Yemen said.\n\nYemenia Air had used the jet since 1999 on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said.

But Thom Filicia, host of the Style Network's \"Dress My Nest,\" author of \"Thom Filicia Style\" and former cast member of \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\" insists that it can be done.\n\n\"Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality,\" Thom Filicia says.\n\n\"I always tell people, 'Start with what you have.' Work as much with what you have as possible, and then fill in where necessary,\" Filicia said.\n\nCNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best.\n\nCNN: When you walk into a room that you're going to redesign, where does your mind first go?\n\nThom Filicia: I look at the layout, I look at the way the space is being used, and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is; that it works really well, it looks good, that you're getting the best views, you're seeing the space, and that you're getting through the space.\n\nCNN: And that's focusing mainly on furniture?\n\nFilicia: That really focuses on all the furniture. You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works. Even if it's great-looking stuff, it sometimes doesn't look as good as it can look.\n\nCNN: What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have?\n\nFilicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works. Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing. Make sure things aren't cluttered.\n\nPaint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality. You could do an accent wall behind your sofa. You could use a low-[volatile organic compound] paint so it's environmentally friendly.\n\nYou can use inexpensive up lights. You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree. You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall. And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer, and you can dim the whole room.\n\nCNN: As far as accessories go, like flowers and pillows, where do you draw the line on too much or not enough?\n\nFilicia: I like to keep things clean and straightforward. I think one floral arrangement is usually enough, or maybe a couple really small cute little ones.\n\nPillows should function. You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable. Start with three: one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right. Add a throw, a rug for underfoot. Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical.\n\nCNN: What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break?\n\nFilicia: People think that dark walls make a room smaller. It actually makes the space bigger. All the corners recede, and it adds a lot of depth. Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces.\n\nCNN: What's the most common mistake that people make?\n\nFilicia: People just don't trust their instincts, and they're not willing to take a risk. Have fun with it. It's only decorating. People tend to go with beige and white just because they're afraid or they don't want to make a commitment.\n\nCNN: If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room, what would you tell them to focus on?\n\nFilicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room. In a bedroom, the anchor piece is your bed. Start with your anchor piece, and that's where you spend your most money.\n\nCNN: You have a new book out now, is that right?\n\nFilicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called \"Thom Filicia Style,\" and it's a great book. It's a lot of fun. It's got a lot of great tips in it. It talks about my philosophy; it talks about color and texture. It's a very comprehensive book with case studies.\n\nCNN: Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget?\n\nFilicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs. Also, just turning your lights off when you're not in a room; when you're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running; taking shorter showers. These are all really simple, easy ways that we can all help Mother Earth repair and heal and replenish itself.\n\n@highlight\n\nThom Filicia of \"Dress My Nest\" gives home decorating tips\n\n@highlight\n\nStyle expert says designing on a budget is simple\n\n@highlight\n\n\"People just don't trust their instincts, and they're not willing to take a risk,\" he says\n\n@highlight\n\nFilicia says there are easy ways to make your home eco-friendly", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3057, "text": "a risk.

The paper said that such unemployment has tripled since the recession began, having reached 15 percent last month. More than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month, with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons: to raise children, or attend college, or because they have just stopped trying to find work.\n\nJoe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said: \"It makes you almost want to go out and rip off all the 'Support Your Troops' bumper stickers. If you want to support your troops, give them a job.\"\n\nCan't argue with that. After what American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are asked to sacrifice, there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families.\n\nThe nation is likely to work on a solution to this honorably and in good faith.\n\nThere was a time, during parallel circumstances, when that wasn't the case. It was one of the darkest moments in American history, and few people speak about it anymore.\n\nThe shorthand for it was \"the Bonus Army.\"\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1932, with the Great Depression gripping the country, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families gathered in Washington to demand what they felt they had been promised. They set up shantytowns, and vowed to stay put until their entreaties were met.\n\nThe federal government had, in 1924, issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from World War I. The certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country. They were like long-term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945.\n\nBut something happened between 1924 and 1932: The economy collapsed. Poverty and joblessness were everywhere. The veterans, many of them hungry and destitute, came to Washington asking Congress to allow them to collect their bonuses early.\n\nIt didn't happen. The U.S. Senate voted down the bill.\n\nSo there were the military veterans, amassed in the nation's capital. Out of money, out of luck, almost out of hope, they refused to leave. The government ordered their evacuation. Many of the veterans resisted; the police shot and killed two of them.\n\nWith that, the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover, fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans, ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation.\n\nAnd this country was confronted with the news that the Army was moving against the old soldiers.\n\nAt the highest level of the Army assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was in command; Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the go-between with the local police force; Maj. George Patton was in charge of the cavalry.\n\nBayonets were drawn; tanks and soldiers on horseback advanced into the crowds; acrid gas was unleashed on the protesting veterans; the makeshift camps were torn down. Even though President Hoover didn't want it to happen, MacArthur sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans' main living quarters. A fire broke out; it was never determined with certainty who set it, but there it was: the American veterans' cobbled-together homes in flames, as the Army drove them out.\n\nThere was no television back then; it is almost impossible to fathom what would have happened if the country had been able to see, live, the military moving relentlessly against former members of the military who were asking for the means to survive.\n\nAs rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families.\n\nLater in their lives, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton all lamented, with varying degrees of emotion, having had to play a role in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington. Their commander in chief had decreed that it must be done, so they carried out his orders.\n\nWe've come a long way since then; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the Army to do such a thing, and it's hard to believe that military officials would not, behind closed doors, try everything in their power to avoid having to use American troops that way.\n\nBut as much as things have changed, certain truths haven't. We ask our soldiers, in times of war, to cross the oceans and fight in our name. When they come home -- those who do come home alive -- we tell them, in bad economic times, that the jobs for them are just not there.\n\nIf our soldiers want to work, we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen. There may never again, we should hope, be a Bonus Army camped in the streets of Washington, pleading for help. The best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point.

Watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage »\n\nIn one scene from the video, a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items. Then he tells the camera he will add the \"special ingredient.\"\n\nThe student then urinates into the mixture, which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave. Other students can be heard laughing on the tape.\n\nThe next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew, saying, \"This is our dorm's 'Fear Factor.' We want to see who has the best 'Fear Factor.'\"\n\nOn the video, the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture.\n\nThe women, on their knees, spit the stew into buckets after tasting it. Some appeared to vomit, but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on.\n\nNext, the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race. The video is put in slow-motion as the theme from \"Chariots of Fire\" plays.\n\nFinally, one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women, telling her she has won the \"Fear Factor.\"\n\nAt the end of the video, a message appears on the screen in Afrikaans saying, \"That, at the end of the day, is what we think of integration.\"\n\nUniversity officials and human rights groups in South Africa denounced the video.\n\n\"The executive management of the [university] condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved,\" said UFS Rector Frederick Fourie in a statement posted on the university's Web site.\n\n\"We have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter,\" he added.\n\nLater Wednesday, Fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them, a statement from the university said. Counseling is being provided for the workers, it added.\n\nThe students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended, Fourie said, and charges against the men will be filed with the South African Police Service.\n\nTwo of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in Bloemfontein, according to the university. Two others completed their studies last year.\n\nThe students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video. I have publicly said several times that the UFS is not a place for racism,\" the rector's statement said.\n\n\"The fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in UFS residences is also most disturbing,\" Fourie said.\n\nA spokeswoman in Free State province for the Democratic Alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all South Africans at the center of its policies -- called the video \"shocking and inhumane.\"\n\n\"It looked like they were willing [participants] but they didn't know what purpose the video served. ... It was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat,\" said spokeswoman Liana Van Wyk, the South African Press Association reported.\n\nHelen Zille, the Democratic Alliance's leader, Wednesday asked the South African Human Rights Commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university.\n\n\"The abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected,\" Zille said in a statement posted on the group's Web site.\n\n\"This incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel [residence] integration,\" she said.\n\nFourie acknowledged in his statement that \"the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity, respect, human dignity and human rights.\"\n\nHe added, \"These kinds of actions make it all the more important that we succeed with establishing such a new institutional culture on the campus. I appeal to all staff and students to remain calm and to act in the best interests of the university.\"\n\nThe university, a research center, is one of South Africa's oldest; founded in 1904. It has more than 25,000 students, according to its Web site, and uses a parallel-medium instruction in English and Afrikaans for its full range of undergraduate and graduate programs.

Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMelanie Phillips of Salem, Oregon: I met George Carlin in the early '70s at a performance he gave at Los Angeles Valley College. The large auditorium was filled to capacity so they closed the doors leaving about 40 people outside. When Carlin came up on stage he asked, \"Who are all those people staring in the windows?\" The host told him the fire marshal had locked them out.\n\nCarlin thought for a moment then asked, \"How many people are allowed to be on stage?\" The legal limit was 50. The comedian turned to the audience and said, \"Forty of you people in the first few rows come up on stage and give those people outside your seats.\" My friend and I ran up on stage and we all gathered in a circle around him, like at a campfire. For the next 90 minutes, Carlin did his entire act by taking our requests, \"Hippy Dippy Weatherman,\" \"Seven Words ...\"\n\nAfter the show was over, he passed through our little circle, shaking hands (including mine) as he quickly made his way off stage to avoid being swamped by fans. It was one of my most memorable experiences and a grand gesture for the 40 fans who had been locked out.\n\nAlexis Karlin of Boston, Massachusetts: When I was little my dad had this box car and one day he put a George Carlin tape in it and it got stuck. So for a year until the car died we listened to this George Carlin tape over and over and over again. ...\n\nI won't miss that car but I will miss George Carlin.\n\nChris Sargent of Laurel, Maryland: Last night, the world's greatest comedian and champion of the First Amendment, George Carlin, died at the age of 71 from heart failure. He was one of the few things my father and I had in common, as I have fond memories of sitting in the living room with him, watching George on HBO, and laughing our a***s off.\n\nHis gift was to make us think about everything. He could play with words and phrases in ways that would put the most highly regarded English professors and linguists to shame.\n\nKevin Eckhoff of Jacksonville, Illinois: George was in classic form as he arrived for a show in late 2004 at the Touhill Performing Arts Center in St. Louis. This was my second time meeting George. He signed the photo from our first meeting, took this new photo, and then proceeded to begin signing my friend's albums. Before he started, he paused, fanned out the records, looked at each, and in his own special way said, \"You know, I go from city to city and you guys (autograph collectors) always have my records in such great shape. Just where the **** do you get these records in such pristine condition?\" We all busted out laughing.\n\nWe'll miss you George!

The three-day ticket price may have been steep -- roughly $300, including service charges -- but when divided among the 131 acts on the bill, that breaks down to less than $2.50 per act.\n\nThis was also the first year concert promoter Goldenvoice offered layaway, which is how 18 percent chose to pay. The strong showing is good news for Bonnaroo, All Points West, Lollapalooza and other festivals taking place this spring and summer. Coachella was also moved up one weekend, which allowed for more kids on spring break to attend.\n\nAlthough Coachella is one of several music festivals in the United States, it still carries a certain cachet that's hard to match. Perhaps it's the scenery -- listening to music on a grassy polo field surrounded by swaying palm trees and craggy desert mountains. Or maybe it's the thrill of discovering new artists and rediscovering old ones standing shoulder-to-shoulder with friends, strangers and the random Hollywood celebrity.\n\nOr maybe it's the wacky moments that seem to happen only under the blistering desert sun.\n\nWhere else could you get Morrissey -- a well-known vegetarian -- complaining in the middle of his Friday set that the smell of burning animals was making him sick, and that he only hoped it was human? The Moz was referring to meat grilling in a food booth across the polo field.\n\nAnd when troubled British neo-soul singer Amy Winehouse dropped out of her Saturday performance because she couldn't get a visa, M.I.A. stepped into her slot on the main stage -- but she apparently wasn't happy about the upgrade. Despite a massive, adoring crowd and a highly charged set, the new mom exclaimed, \"This is the main stage? Next time, I'm back in a tent! I prefer the sweat!\"\n\nThis was after her tongue-in-cheek nod to Winehouse, where she sang, \"They tried to make me do the Oscars, I said, 'No, no, no.' \"\n\nThen, there were the memorable music moments. Friday headliner Sir Paul McCartney didn't end his playful, hit-filled set until about 54 minutes past the midnight curfew -- for a potential fine of $54,000. (According to Benjamin Guitron, media relations officer for the Indio Police Department, the promoter agrees to pay $1,000 for every minute past 12 a.m.)\n\nOn Saturday, Seattle, Washington, indie pop band Fleet Foxes drew an overflowing crowd to the Outdoor Theatre, charming the audience with its delicate, baroque harmonies. Sunday headliners The Cure played 31 songs from the group's vast catalog -- concentrating heavily on early material, and for the most part, staying away from the biggest radio hits. They, too, played well past curfew -- continuing with their third encore even after the sound from the main PA system was cut off.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine -- whose four members reunited last year after a decade apart -- was also a crowd pleaser, although an interlude where they played a single chord at maximum decibels for a mind-numbing 15 minutes left fans scratching their heads.\n\nPerry Farrell is the only artist who's performed at all 10 Coachella festivals -- in Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party, as his alter ego DJ Peretz and in other incarnations. This year, he dueted with Thievery Corporation on the main stage, then headed over to the dance tent, where he joined his wife, Etty, for an electronic set.\n\n\"I would probably silently be very depressed if they wouldn't invite me, to tell you the truth. My mental health depends on them,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nDespite a time of belt-tightening, festivalgoers are finding a way to let it all hang out. According to The Desert Sun, the local newspaper, even two former first daughters couldn't resist the draw of the desert. It said Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager dropped into Coachella on Saturday -- complete with Secret Service.\n\nGuitron couldn't confirm the report, but he did say, \"I wouldn't be surprised if they did show up. Dignitaries just kind of show up like everybody else.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nCoachella music festival wraps up Sunday\n\n@highlight\n\nIntriguing moments include vegetarian Morrissey complaining about grilling\n\n@highlight\n\nBoth Paul McCartney and The Cure run past curfew; Cure is cut off", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2264, "text": "Morrissey"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which vegetarian is mentioned?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b1502ba57a7d0f7db23e1bbb0848e9ec6aad5c80.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3850, "text": "sound from the main PA system"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What is cut off?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b1502ba57a7d0f7db23e1bbb0848e9ec6aad5c80.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3114, "text": "Paul McCartney"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who ran past curfew?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b1502ba57a7d0f7db23e1bbb0848e9ec6aad5c80.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 193, "text": "Coachella.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which music festival will wrap up Sunday?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b1502ba57a7d0f7db23e1bbb0848e9ec6aad5c80.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 658, "text": "Day 3"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "When does Coachella wrap up?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b1502ba57a7d0f7db23e1bbb0848e9ec6aad5c80.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2357, "text": "smell of burning animals"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What did Morrissey complain about?", "id": "./cnn/stories/b1502ba57a7d0f7db23e1bbb0848e9ec6aad5c80.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Hugh Masekela is the legendary South African musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid. He tells CNN about growing up under apartheid, why he left South Africa and what is was like to move back to Johannesburg after 30 years away.\n\nHugh Masekela: \"The people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom.\"\n\nCNN: How did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art?\n\nHugh Masekela: I don't think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance. We have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing.\n\nBut in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song. I think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance.\n\nWe grew up in rallies and in the street. We didn't have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening.\n\nWatch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg ».\n\nCNN: What's your earliest memory of Johannesburg?\n\nHM: I came to Jo' burg from Springs [a town near Johannesburg]. My family moved to Alexandra township and the first time I went to town alone I must have been 10 or 11. Jo' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle. I remember that because I came from Alexander township where there were no lights, no sewage and no cafes.\n\nThe most vivid memory I have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food, and we'd say \"what do you think that is?\" and \"there are so many types of food!\"\n\nCNN: How did it feel to leave South Africa?\n\nHM: When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in South Africa. I wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught Miles Davis and Clifford Brown and Chad Baker and they were not in South Africa. I hoped that one day I could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach.\n\nIt was a rough time, when the apartheid government first started showing that if you don't behave, they'll shoot you -- women and children too. You saw police with guns, with machine guns, and for the first time you saw tanks.\n\nWe had a group called the Jazz Epistles and we were about to take off on a national tour. We were the first African group to play on an LP, but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we couldn't do our tour.\n\nBut four years later, when I was ready to come back to South Africa, I couldn't. The place was impenetrable. By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to.\n\nSee Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg »\n\nCNN: Tell us about coming home.\n\nHM: It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa and we were not naive about it. It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening.\n\nWhen I left South Africa there were 10 million people -- when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways. And I had to adjust my language because people would say \"we don't' talk like that anymore!\" I was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things.\n\nNot many people came back from exile compared with those who left. About a million left -- 50,000 came back, and of those about 25,000 did a U-turn because it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy but it's been a great experience.\n\nCNN: How would you define the culture of Jo' burg?\n\nHM: There's no one culture -- it's a cosmopolitan city. It's so diverse, like South Africa itself has so many diverse cultures.\n\nBut again, we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping. If we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance, it would be the shining path.\n\nCNN: Where do you like to go out in Jo' burg?\n\nHM: I go to Newtown, I go to the Market Theater a lot, and also to the Dance Forum, because we have very brilliant dance choreographers. Old Jo' burg was vibrant, there were things going on all the time -- concerts, festivals, clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night.\n\nCNN: What is life like in the city?\n\nHM: It's not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time. There's a sadness about this city that everybody talks about.\n\nPeople in South Africa have become inward; they spend most of the time in their homes. When it gets dark, everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can. That is not only Jo' burg's problem, it is a national problem.\n\nWhat we're talking about doesn't make me very popular with the people who run this country, but it's nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day.\n\nIt has to be fixed, because the people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say \"this is my country.\"\n\n@highlight\n\nHugh Masekela songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid\n\n@highlight\n\nHe left South Africa to get a musical education and couldn't return for 30 years\n\n@highlight\n\nUnder apartheid black South Africans were resilient through song, he says\n\n@highlight\n\nHe says Johannesburg is cosmopolitan and multicultural, like South Africa", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2733, "text": "The place was impenetrable."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "He couldn't return because of what?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3915, "text": "diverse,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What makes Johannesburg and South Africa so cosmopolitan?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 67, "text": "South African musician"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who is Hugh Masekela?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 36, "text": "Hugh Masekela"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Who's songs were the inspiration?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 14, "text": "South Africa"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Where is Johannesburg?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 122, "text": "in the fight to end apartheid."}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What was the inspiration?", "id": "./cnn/stories/9f054c85616ff47b771a11bca9bc434403cecd46.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/dcebe447c665a12ff14efffe32152cd0785e5204.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Sara, 29, has lived in Miami for five years, where she works as freelance writer and film maker. Her blog, All Purpose Dark, keeps tabs on the city's nightlife and restaurants, and she is also the editor of the Miami edition of UrbanDaddy.com.\n\nSara has lived in Miami for five years and says the city has a vibrant arts scene.\n\nCNN: What made you start blogging the city?\n\nSara: When I moved down here I realized there was so much more to the city than just the beach and the hotels.\n\nThere were lots of extravagant condo-building parties at the time -- the type where you'd go to the construction site, because the building was still in the planning stages, and they'd throw this lavish catered party with open bar and feather dancers in an effort to get people to buy units. We were going to at least three of these events a week and I felt the need to document it.\n\nSo my blog started out as kind of a nightlife, event-driven blog and eventually became a chronicle of my adventures in the city, focused now mostly on my eating adventures.\n\nCNN: What makes Miami so special to you?\n\nSara: I think Miami is a place of unbridled optimism. It's also a place of great opportunity. There's lots of room here for entrepreneurial spirit and it's very much encouraged and appreciated. Just look at how much the city has changed in five years, in terms of the revival of Downtown and the Design District, and the thriving art scene. It's a place that is still evolving identity-wise and I'm excited to be a part of it.\n\nCNN: Is there anything you dislike about the city?\n\nSara: The seasonal aspect of the city can be frustrating -- the way it shuts down in the summer and then revs up in the winter.\n\nAlso, the crowding in the winter, when all the seasonal residents come back and suddenly there are no parking spaces, the lines at the grocery store are horrendous and you realize you're trying to live in a tourist Mecca and get your errands done when everyone around you is vacationing. Oh and the drivers -- possibly the worst driving etiquette in the country.\n\nCNN: Is Miami just about the sun and sand, or is there more to it?\n\nSara: There's definitely more to this city than the tropical getaway. There's a vibrant art scene, where each month the gallery district is alive with opening receptions and throngs of people interested in getting out and seeing the scene. There's also the internationally renowned Art Basel art fair that comes to town every year putting Miami on the cultural map.\n\nAlso, food-wise there's lots of exciting things going on, from an incredibly diverse selection of Latin cuisine. Everything from Argentinean to Venezuelan food, to Haitian, to Caribbean -- there's a ton of great ethnic food here. There's also a growing high-end dining scene, where a lot of the national trends, like organic, locally sourced cooking, are happening on a very high level.\n\nCNN: Could you describe a typical Miamian's weekend?\n\nSara: A typical weekend would probably entail going to dinner in the Design District on Friday night, going for a walk or a bike ride along the beach on Saturday morning, then lunch on Lincoln Road. Saturday night there are usually some great DJs in town, so it's worth checking out the Downtown club scene, or if it's Art Walk, the galleries in Wynwood.\n\nSunday is spent perusing farmers markets, which are popping up in most neighborhoods, and lazily reading the paper over brunch. Sunday night is always bingo at the Standard hotel, a hipster hangout.\n\nCNN: Where do you shop?\n\nSara: I usually head to the Aventura Mall if I'm looking to hit a bunch of stores in one fix. There's Bloomingdales, Urban Outfitters and your typical mall stores, like Banana Republic, etc. Collins Avenue in South Beach between 10th and 6th is good for Barney's Co-op (where there's always a sale), Intermix and the Webster.\n\nCNN: If Miami was a person, what would she or he be like?\n\nSara: Attractive, laid back and stylish.

The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing.\n\nStiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving.\n\nA former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news.\n\n\"I've had my share of nightmares,\" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace.\n\nThomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a \"weapons enthusiast\" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos »\n\n\"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said.\n\nStiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault.\n\nJerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred.\n\nHenderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him.\n\nDye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity.\n\n\"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles. I'm the guy you're looking for,'\" Dye said. \"At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'\"\n\nDye said Stiles was calm and cooperative.\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search.\n\nThe tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.\n\nHe turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month.\n\nProfessionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be \"healthy and fine and happy,\" her mother's attorney said this month.\n\nThe mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said.\n\n\"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,' \" Donohue said.\n\nDonohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer.\n\nThe alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said.\n\nAnother former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \"mortified\" by the allegations against him.\n\n\"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said.\n\nAllen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived.\n\nAlso living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video.

Gulf of Aden.\n\nInternational naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks.\n\nThe 32,000-tonne Malaspina Castle was taken early on Monday and was believed to be heading towards Somalia's pirate-infested coast, the European Union's Horn of Africa maritime security center said.\n\n\"Few details are known at this stage, but the mixed-nationality crew is believed to be safe,\" a statement on the London-based organization's Web site said.\n\nThe vessel, which is operated by an Italian company, carried a crew of 24, from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia and the Philippines, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported.\n\n\"There have not yet been communications from the Malaspina Castle that we are aware of, so information is limited,\" said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers' Assistance Program in quotes carried by the Telegraph.\n\nHe added: \"It is likely to be taken towards the Somali coast and negotiations will begin soon.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC reported that a Taiwanese fishing boat, with a crew of 29, was also hijacked Monday approximately 260km (160 miles) from the Seychelles.\n\nThe latest attacks follow a string of incidents in the pirate-plagued waterway off Somalia at the weekend, with a French yacht, a Yemeni tugboat and a German ship also reported to have been seized.\n\nLast year, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau.\n\nIn response, a number of countries have deployed warships from their navies to the region, including the United States, China and Japan.\n\nMonday's seizure of the Malaspina Castle was immediately condemned by the UK ship masters' union Nautilus, which has long urged governments to take stronger action to deter piracy.\n\nNautilus assistant general secretary Mark Dickinson told the British Press Association: \"Over the last 10 years, most governments have not really done very much about this.\n\n\"More recently they have been motivated to act and there is an EU naval coordination force patrolling off the Gulf of Aden.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm not sure that this is going to be a long-term thing and I'm also worried that the pirates will start seizing ships well away from the areas being patrolled.\n\n\"In Somalia, piracy is like a big, successful industry and the authorities there need to act. The pirates are treated like local heroes. People look up to them and girls want to marry them.

A single bullet struck her chest, and Neda was dead.\n\nOn Monday, Long Island University announced it was awarding a 2009 George Polk Award, one of journalism's highest honors, to the unknown videographer who captured Neda's final moments -- her collapse on the street and her death. The New York Times reports that this is the first time in the 61-year history of the prestigious awards that judges have given the honor to work done anonymously.\n\n\"This video footage was seen by millions and became an iconic image of the Iranian resistance,\" John Darnton, curator of the Polk Awards, told the newspaper. \"We don't know who took it or who uploaded it, but we do know it has news value. This award celebrates the fact that, in today's world, a brave bystander with a cellphone camera can use video-sharing and social networking sites to deliver news.\"\n\nThe New York Times: Polk award winners include anonymous video uploader\n\nGeorge Polk Awards in Journalism: 2009 winners\n\nCNN: Neda was 'like an angel,' mother says\n\nWilliam Ward Warren: When President Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy arrived at Dallas Love Field on November 22, 1963, there were as many as 100 photographers there, mostly shooting black and white film. On Monday, the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas released never-before-seen, 8 mm amateur color film taken by Warren.\n\nAccording to a release by museum curator Gary Mack, Warren was 15 at the time of the assassination, and because students were given the day off for the president's visit, he took his camera to Love Field to watch the arrival of Air Force One.\n\n\"My dad operated a furniture store adjacent to the airport, and so that morning on his way to work, he dropped me off at the airport to see [President Kennedy] come in,\" Warren said, according to the museum release. \"It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement.\"\n\nKennedy was killed less than an hour after Warren captured the start of his visit to Texas. The owner of a freight brokerage business, Warren, now 61, lives in north Texas with his wife and children.\n\nCNN: Watch the footage from the Sixth Floor Museum\n\nCNN: Film released of JFK arrival in Dallas\n\nSixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza\n\nDafna Michaelson: The former director of volunteer services at a Denver, Colorado, hospital -- and a single mother of two children -- left her job and spent all 52 weeks of 2009 traveling to all 50 states and Washington. She funded her \"50 in 52 Journey\" by draining her 401k -- the entire $31,000 -- and then asking others for donations.\n\nHer goal was to collect the stories of ordinary Americans who were making a difference in their local communities and to share those stories on her Web site. She ultimately interviewed more than 500 people, blogged regularly and posted 370 videos.\n\nIn January, she launched the Journey Institute, telling CNN on Monday, \"One main thing I heard while traveling was, if they didn't have someone to push them or mentor them or train them, they wouldn't have been able to put their idea into action.\"\n\nSo after her journey, Michaelson decided to help people get their ideas off the couch and put them into action. Her plan is to bring people from every state facing similar challenges to Denver and give them training on how to solve those problems.\n\nMichaelson said, \"No matter where I went, I met people who were the same as the pioneers who built this country. They not only had to build their barns and plant their fields, they had to help their neighbors do the same. The people I met had the same values as those pioneers.\"\n\n50 in 52 Journey Web site\n\nThe Denver Post: Woman travels nation, documents people making life better\n\nKim Jong Il: Tuesday is the \"Dear Leader's\" birthday, but where, do you ask, was he born in 1942? His official biography declares it was at the foothills of Mount Baekdu, North Korea's sacred mountain, amid bright lights and double rainbows. But historians are pretty sure he was born at a guerrilla base under Soviet protection in the Soviet Union. The discrepancy should not surprise. When Time magazine's Frances Romero wrote about the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the profile began, \"An easy way of summing up Kim's life in one sentence would be to throw in the words reportedly, allegedly and the occasional is said to.\"\n\nHis father, Kim Il Sung, founded North Korea, and his son ran the country more or less for 20 years as his father aged, taking power officially in 1997, a few years after his father's death. \"Here's a guy who is very concerned about his physical stature, among other things,\" said Dr. Jerrold Post, a former CIA psychologist who heads the political psychology program at George Washington University. \"He's 5-foot-2 and wears 4-inch lifts in his shoes.\"\n\nPost, in his book \"Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World,\" writes that Kim also loved to drink a certain Hennessy cognac that sold for $630 a bottle in Korea. Hennessy, the maker of Paradis cognac, confirmed that Kim was the biggest buyer of the cognac, and between 1988 and 1998, maintained an estimated annual account of $650,000 to $800,000.\n\nPost wrote the ruler \"annually spent 770 times the income of the average North Korean citizen ($1,038) on cognac alone!\" Post told CNN that Kim Jong Il once kidnapped the most prominent South Korean movie star and kept her under house arrest with her husband for eight years. And he has a collection of some 20,000 videotapes, including the complete James Bond movie collection.\n\nIn August 2008, Kim had a stroke and was out of view for some time, and now seems to have recovered. Post said he believes that some of his toughness on North Korean nuclear policy now may be the indication of a power struggle at the end of his rule.\n\nCNN: North Korea marks Kim Jong Il's birthday\n\nCNN: Mystery has surrounded Kim Jong Il\n\nTime: Two-minute bio: Kim Jong Il\n\nBode Miller: NBC Winter Games anchor Bob Costas said this weekend that the word \"redemption\" may be the most overused cliché in all of Olympics coverage, but it pretty much describes Bode Miller's downhill race Monday.\n\nSports Illustrated and the U.S. Ski Team Web site report that Miller, winner of 32 World Cup races, won two silver medals in Salt Lake City, Utah, but none during any of his five races at the Turin Olympics in in Italy in 2006. Then in May 2007, Miller announced he was leaving the U.S. Ski Team to race independently, only to rejoin the team in 2009.\n\nMonday in Vancouver, British Columbia, Miller won a bronze medal in the men's Olympic downhill, finishing behind Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who took silver, and gold medal winner Didier Defago of Switzerland. Miller missed the gold by nine one-hundredths of a second, but he now holds the U.S. record for most medals in Alpine skiing. According to his official biography, Miller was born in New Hampshire in 1977, was home-schooled until fourth grade and started skiing at 3.\n\nU.S. Ski Team: Bode Miller bio\n\nSI: Bode Miller career highlights\n\nCNN: Winter Olympics coverage\n\nWhat makes a person intriguing?\n\nThere are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news.\n\nSome of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.\n\nBut every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in.\n\nThey arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.\n\n@highlight\n\nJournalism award goes to anonymous uploader of video showing Iran protester's death\n\n@highlight\n\nNewly released footage of President Kennedy's 1963 arrival in Dallas, Texas, revealed\n\n@highlight\n\nU.S. skier earns bronze in Vancouver after failing to reach podium in 2006", "qas": [{"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What does award winning video show?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1020, "text": "2009 George Polk Award,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "what goes to anonymous uploader of video showing Iran protester's?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 7462, "text": "2009.\\"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which medal did U.S. skier earn in Vancouver?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "Who won the award?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1967, "text": "Kennedy"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "Which president is arriving in Dallas in newly released footage?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}, {"answers": [], "is_impossible": true, "question": "What did the video show?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1020, "text": "2009 George Polk Award,"}], "is_impossible": false, "question": "What  medal was won by the U.S.?", "id": "./cnn/stories/1915dd69481b5f6033f91054ffdad42be380c215.story"}]}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/c9160e2f5ce386dabb10517e7a5c0933c01a9546.story", "paragraphs": [{"context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Mohammed Rasoul, his right leg severed below the knee, maneuvers on crutches over the dirt and loose stones through the Falluja graveyard.\n\nMohammed Rasoul sitting with his mother, Jinan Khalifa, eagerly awaits his trip to the United States.\n\nRow after row of headstones stand as the deadly reminder of the tragedy the city went through as insurgents battled for control of the city.\n\nMohammed stops at his cousin's grave. \"I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,\" he told CNN at a visit to the grave a few months ago. As he spoke, he poured water on a tree he planted next to it.\n\nThe headstone reads: \"Martyr 643, the child Hajer Ismael Khalil, 13 October 2006.\"\n\nClutching her photograph, Mohammed says, \"My cousin died on the scene.

He will be fitted for a prosthetic leg in coming weeks and examined to see if he needs additional surgery. Montanti said her organization has a list of other young Iraqi children in need of help. \"The word needs to get out.\"\n\nAsked how it makes her feel to help Mohammed, she says, \"It makes me cry with joy.\"\n\nMohammed, too, is ecstatic. \"I didn't think this act of human kindness would be presented to me,\" he says. \"I didn't have hope in Iraq -- hope that I would ever get my hope back. I didn't have a future.\"\n\nHe adds, \"I want to go to America and meet this person that gave me my future back.\"\n\nWhen he comes back home, he wants to help rebuild Falluja, starting with his school, which was bombed during the 2004 Falluja offensive.\n\n\"I will never leave school and, God willing, I will continue my education and become an architect and build all the schools,\" he says, standing on his crutches.\n\nBut first, he says, he wants to walk to water the tree he planted next to his cousin's grave.
